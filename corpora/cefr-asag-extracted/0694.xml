        <answer>I totally believe that everyone has the right to privacy. If we like a singer it's because we love his songs, if we vote for a president it is to defend our  ideas and our rights. What public people do in their private life only concerns themselves...</answer>
        <answer>I think paparzzis should be punished for revealing the private stories of the stars... by harrassing them they can push them to depression or even worst... those people are locked up in their golden prisons. For this reason I would really not appreciate being known. It must be very  stressful to always hide yourself and see pictures of your private life in magasins made for stupid people that finance this junk business.</answer>
        <answer>If a politician is disturbed after somebody revealed a part of his private life he will be less efficient in his function because he will always have to justify himslef to the press.... according to me it there is more and more junk information that we don't need to know instead of telling us the truth about real matters.</answer>
