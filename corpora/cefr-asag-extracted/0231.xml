        <answer>The first question is: How can i get 1 million euros? Dealing drugs? Get a offshore account? Mmmh maybe get married with an old rich wife? But anyway.. That's not the point! If i had one million euros, i will be first really really happy! But attention! I've to keep my mind cold! I must do a goed use of this money! When you beome rich, the next step is getting richer... So i think that i will buy a lot of sure actions in Wall street and make sure that they don't increase... Next step, i must engage an accountant to be sure that i won't spend my money in one day. So i would entoure myself with professionals, and make my fortune grown. and after that when i will be sure that i don't have to work for the rest of my life, i would give a lot of money to my parents and my brothers (before i must be perfectly sure that that they will do a good use of this money too). i would give a lot of money to a lot to charity. And at the end, buying a lot of useless to have the impress that my new life is better than the last.</answer>
