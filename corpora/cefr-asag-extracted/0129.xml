        <answer>The best book I've ever read is one of a writer called Wilbur Smith.</answer>
        <answer>First of all it melts history and an invented story. It's very interesting to understand the lifestyles of sailors during a war.</answer>
        <answer>Moreover the context is very attractive ans there is a lot of actions! It occured in the 16th century when two countries (Holland and England) were fighting against each other to have the most territories in South Africa as they could! But one day peace was decided. The problem is that the sailors hadn't any idea that the war was over and they continued to fight, steal, and kill. It was of course illegal because they were not ennemies anymore!</answer>
