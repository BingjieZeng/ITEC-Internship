        <answer>I think the best book I ever read was Harry Potter. I was quite jong when I read it for the first time, but I immediatly fell in love with the hero and the story. Since then I read them all multiple time, appreciating other part of the story because I was changing with time. When I was eleven I was waiting for my letter to Hogward with hope. (Actually it never came but when I read them again, it's like I'm there so it's no big deal.) Now it's a part of my culture and I always like to speak with friends about it.</answer>
