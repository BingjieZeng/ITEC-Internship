        <answer>It is not a question easy to answer because I read a lot of books each year. But I like reading thriller book and the problem is very difficult to find a good thriller with a good intrigue. But one of the last I read was astonishing and surprizing. This book is &quot;Before I go to sleep&quot; written by S.J Watson. The suspense is present until the last page of this book and it is genial when the writer succeeds it. I did not expect for the end and I like feeling it because it means that the writer has done his job, it is to say, keep us in suspense.</answer>
