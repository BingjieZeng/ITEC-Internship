        <answer>First, it's important to modify our behaviour when we have to move ! Nowadays, the car is the easier mode of locomotion but this is not the best. Public transports are a good solution. The problem is that these public transports aren't well organized. When you want to go to a big city, you can note that there are not enough parkings near the stations, the underground, then you go further with your car... And another problem of public transports is the lack of fiability, the failure to respect timetables, they are too often late so the people are discouraged and they return to their cars...</answer>
        <answer>Another point that could be improved is the household waste. When we go to the supermarket, too much products are packed with plastic. Before, paper was used to pack goods and paper is recycable, that's a better solution, it's the same with the bottles, too much are also in plastic material and that's difficult to recycle.</answer>
