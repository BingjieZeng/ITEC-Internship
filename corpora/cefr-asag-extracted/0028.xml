        <answer>Dear,</answer>
        <answer>Firstly I'm writing to you because I'm so thankfull for the invitation about your birthday. It's so great to help you as well for that day so special for you and your family.</answer>
        <answer>These days, I thought about some ideas to help you because I want that you will never forget that night, you and everyone!!!! So I suggest you to do that in a castle with big spaces. I suggest also to invit only your friends and no one that you don't know because it can be dangerous!! And to finish, I suggest you to make a dinner with your close friend before the &quot;big night&quot;!!</answer>
        <answer>Lots of kisses and see you soon.</answer>
