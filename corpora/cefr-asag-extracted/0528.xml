        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I would stop looking for a job and i would create my own company. I'm too scared to do it without already having all that money because I'm not a big risk taker and I don't want to put myself into money troubles at this young age if it didn't work. But the idea of creating something, of giving people a job, adding value to the society is something that I love.</answer>
