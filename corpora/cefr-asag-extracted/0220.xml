        <answer>Last week, I attended a big fashion event in Paris. I went to Paris from thursday to monday evening. Paris is a fantastic city! The event was on saturday night in a big historic monument. It was magical. I met a lot of big names of the fashion industry. The show was on the afternoon, it started on 3 pm and ended one hour later. Before the show, a lot of photographs were at the entrance to take pictures of the last fashion clothes of the spectators. Once we were inside, we could find on each seats bags with presents from the brand in it, it is always great to receive free products from a brand. The show was beautiful, no one of the models did fall and their clothes were very nice. After that, I visit Paris. On monday evening, unfortunetly, I had to go back home, in Belgium. I spent a very good time on the event, a memory to always remember.</answer>
