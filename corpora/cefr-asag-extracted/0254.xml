        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, it would be difficult for me to choose what I would do with it. There are so many people or causes that I want to help and support, and so (this is more selfish, I agree) many things I want to buy! In the first place, I would think about the people I love, and get them evrything they deserve. I want to give them happiness in all the way possible, and if money can be one, so will I spend some of my million on them.  What would be important for me too, is supporting the associations and places that I agree with. I'm very invested in animal rescueing, refugee helping and fighting against poverty.</answer>
