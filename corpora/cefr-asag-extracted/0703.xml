        <answer>Though the balance diet surely helps to live an healthy life, it is thus not in my eyes, the most important factor.  Quality! That what we need.  Food is fuel for our body.</answer>
        <answer>The lower the quality of the food, the more we need to ingest in order to reach the needed levels of vitamins and minerals. Our vitality and mood depend on those, but we than endanger our weight!</answer>
