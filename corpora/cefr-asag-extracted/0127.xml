        <answer>The best book I've ever read is The Harry Potter Saga. I appreciated the  wizards' magic world. It made me dream. Moreover I identified myself with the characters, especially Hermione Granger who's very brilliant and smart. What was funny is that I was as old as the characters. I also liked the plot and the suspense throughout the chapters and books. It captivated me. At the end of the saga, I was so sad but fortunately there were the movies. But I thought that they were not as good as the books.</answer>
