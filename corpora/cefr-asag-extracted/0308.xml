        <answer>I think it is better to have an enjoyable job than to make more money.</answer>
        <answer>If you decide to do a job in which you know you could make a lot of money, you might didn't appreciate that job and then you will be  unhappy. Yes you will have money, but does it make sense to have money without being happy?</answer>
        <answer>But if you prefer to work for something you're involved in and you like, your job will be more enjoyable. Maybe you won't have as much money as you could have earned with an other job, but i think your life will be easier.</answer>
        <answer>My last argument is that if you do something you love, you are more likely to do it well than if it was something you didin't like.</answer>
