        <answer>We all have a right to privacy, people in the public eye aren't an exception, but the extent of their privacy depends on the function they have. There are limits to privacy for people in the public eye, nonetheless. A politician should have the right to go on holiday and live with his or her family without people snooping on them, but must remain open when excercising their public functions. Celebrities should be allowed to be left alone as long as they attempt to remain anonymous, but they waiver that right when they try and use their influence as a public figure to gain specific advantages. Notorious Criminals in the public eye should also expect to lose alot of their rights to privacy- personal rights end when the rights of others are compromised.</answer>
