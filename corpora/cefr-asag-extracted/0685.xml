        <answer>Eating a balanced diet is indeed recommended for a healthy life. This covers what you eat and drink. Doctors use to say that you should eat at least five fruits or vegetables every day. Drinking too much alcohol can be damageable to your body. Men are allowed three alcoholic drinks per day, while women are allowed only two. Whatever the beverage (wine, beer, digestive, ...) the quantity of alcohol is the same in one standard glass, since glasses are smaller for drinks that contain a higher concentration in alcohol. Unfortunately, nothing is black or white: experts also recognize benefits in drinking a reasonable quantity of alcohol. Red wine, for example, is known for its benefits on your blood pressure.</answer>
