        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I think that I would make a big travel in different country with my partner. After I will offer some gifts to my mother, things that she dreams of. The ret of the money would be use to buy a beautiful house with a garden, maybe one or two cars. I will also make a donation to an association. The rest of the money will be place at the bank in this case I would be able to offer an beautiful amount to my children when they will lift the house.</answer>
