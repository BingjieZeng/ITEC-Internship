        <answer>I think that public transport should be less expensive, and more reliable.</answer>
        <answer>Public transport are more and more on strike for bad reasons, and passengers are always taken hostage. Busses and taxis pollute a lot in towns. They should use an electrical engine to ride in towns, with batteries rechargeable from the sun.</answer>
        <answer>For example there is not enough places in my train on the morning, so I have to take my own car to go to work, so do all my colleagues...</answer>
        <answer>Unfortunately cars with electric engine are too expensive for me to by one, and the electrical battery life is not good enough to ride all day long.</answer>
