        <answer>I fully agree with this proposition.  I didn't have the opportunity to study abroad after High School or Univerity but I think it 's really a very interesting experience.  There are many benefits: learn a language  morequickly, increase the skills to speak  with more insurance, hear the correct pronunciation and also develop our networking abroad.  For my job,I was in CERAN last year durong a week and my progess were awersome just because I spoke in Englis all the day! The immersion allows also to &quot;think&quot; in the new language. So if the Education could oranise one year aobraod for all students, it will we really a chance for them. But be carefful, financing this project is surely an important challenge! If study abroad becomes an &quot;obligation&quot;, every student should have the possibility to do it with the same opportunities!</answer>
