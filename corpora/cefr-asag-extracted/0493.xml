        <answer>Last year, I went to Antalya for ten days with my girlfriend. Antalya is a big region in the south of Turkije, very quiet and hot city. The people are very friendly and respectable. In the morning we took the breakfast at the hotel. After the breakfast we went every day for a few hours to relaxed in the swiming pool. Because it's too hot to go outside to walk in the afternoon! It was fourty degrees! Before dinner we did a little sport, we played voley beach and water polo, it was very nice. In the evenning we had shower en we went outisde the hotel to visit the city and walk. Very nice holiday, we go again to Turkije.</answer>
