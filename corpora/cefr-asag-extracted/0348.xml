        <answer>While most people in this society believe it is beter to make money, I would argue that it is more important to have an inspiring job.</answer>
        <answer>It is generally accepted that a person works almost 30 years in his life. In other words, his job takes the major part of his time. It is therefore important to like what he are doing. Otherwise, he is more subject to depression. It is not a coincidence that the major problem of today is the burnout.</answer>
        <answer>However, it is probably true to say that making money could keep people happy. By this I mean that money can contribute to an adequate living standard.</answer>
        <answer>Taking everything into consideration, it is important to have a compromise between an enjoyable job and a job that pays enough to live corretly.</answer>
