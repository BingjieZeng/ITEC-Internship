        <answer>This book, is for me, the beginning of the vampire style, the horror/fantaisy one. The support of all vampire style with the real Count Dracula. This story is, today as well, use as background for some books, movies and son one. proof that this book is special.</answer>
        <answer>In my opinion, it s very well writen, catching , the characters are touching, with their own stories, values. Even if the book is old, with some progress of science that won t make possible some part of the book ( like when they do a transfusion withouth compare the blood groups ... ) , it s still catchy and possible to read. Some old book are boring , values are too much  differents, or just the story can be known before the end.</answer>
