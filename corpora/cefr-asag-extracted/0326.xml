        <answer>If we assume that the goal of a human being is to make is life easy enjoyable, in other words to have a happy life, it sounds obvious to me that it implicates to have an enjoyable job. Because without this enjoyable job your life looks pointless and you go to work only waiting the end of it. What an awfull way of living. But we can't ignore the reality of life.  A good job that is not able to give you a enough money to live a good life outside your work is also pointless. Therefore i'm not shure we should choose one of the two goals you propose us, I think we should mix them and aim to have a good balanced job with fun on the first side but als money.</answer>
