        <answer>I usually get up at 7 since I finished work. I take my breakfast and have a shower. Then I usually read for half an hour, before I go out for a walk. I don't run but I like very much to step fast for more or less an hour. When I come back home, I drink a coffee and I do what I have to (iron, PC , ....) Two times a week (tuesday and friday), I eat at noon with my friend {name} and sometimes, after, we go for shopping or for a movie. When it's about six o'clock, I prepare dinner and my husband and I eat about seven. After, I often read again for an hour or two, or I watch Tv until we go to bed at eleven. Every wednesday it's &quot;grandchildren day&quot;! I like my new life very much!</answer>
