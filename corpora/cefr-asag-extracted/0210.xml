        <answer>The best book I've ever read was &quot;La guerre des clans&quot;. I was 14 when I read it for the first time. Sure I was yong and I've read many other books since then. But this book is the one that makes me love reading. I can't explain why, cause I think nobody could understand. When I've been telling my friends about that book, they were not really excited... Well, it's a story about cats. Maybe they were thinking it was a book for children, but it wasn't. Even if the main characters were all cats, I could easy imagine they were humans. In the book, they can speak, they're feeling and thinking like humans would do. To be honnest the only difference was that they were fighting with claws instead of weapons. That's not a bad thing.</answer>
