        <answer>I would try to convice poilitics that our productions's method is way less efficient than other methods. As an example, permacultural production of food which try to work with the nature instead of working against, has already prooved his ability to feed a good amount of population without causing any damages to the nature we're living in. It goes even more than than the only production of food. Indeed, the idea is to help the nature by recreate nice conditions for her to expand herself. This method is a good response to deserts due only to abusive deforestation. We can apply this method for ourserlves, but the deal is becoming so much important that we have to implicate politics into that matter. It might be hard, as this new method can't be used for big marchandizing and only work at local level. That is why anybody can start to practise on they own, wherever there are -even in cities - but they must keep in mind that the idea must appear at a largest level.</answer>
