        <answer>I don't know if I prefere to draw or to cook. Drawing, because when I was a little girl, I used to draw everything I saw, everytime. And people told me I was an artist. But now, I don't draw anymore because I think that I don't have this &quot;mind child&quot; I had. I'm more intrested by food and health. One day, I want to be vegan, so I love cooking healthy meal, with organic food. It make me feel so good in my body and in my mind.</answer>
