        <answer>The best book I have read ? In fact, those are every book of Guillaume Musso. Personally I can't say this book is better than an other because I liked all of  them. The universe of his books is the same in every book except the story and the figures. There are also two cities ( one in France and the other in the United States) and a love story with some mysteries. Sometimes some figures disappear or come out. His books are awazing from the beginning to the end. Guillaume Musso is in the habit of making his figures lovable. He includes at the beginning of every chapter of his books a quote and it is very pleasant to read, that inspire me a lot. He has an unbounded imagination. In most of the case, we are surprised at the end of the book because the situation turn around.</answer>
