        <answer>Study abroad will allways be an interesting way to learn foreign langages, other peoples and ways of life.  Meanwhile, you can't oblige someone to be interested by those matters.  In such a case, it will be a loss of time and money.  I prefer someone, maybe with a limited ambition for his carreer, studying in his country because he will feel free, moving in his familial neighbourood, remaining in good conditions for his scolarity.  Leaving your cocoon, your family, your friends, your country to study abroad could be felt by a boy (or a girl) like jumping from a plane without a parachute!  It's not always the case.  Some students go away with friends.  Some others are so strongly motivated that they don't be afraid of that big jump!</answer>
