        <answer>Thank you for your invitation.</answer>
        <answer>I will bring some food and drinks. If you don't have any ideas for your party, I can give you some : maybe you could bring us to the cinema or to the attraction park, and we could maybe stay the whole night. I heard X was gonna bring some junk food and beers. That would be great for the night. Call me back to tell me what you think about this.</answer>
