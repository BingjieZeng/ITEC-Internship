        <answer>It isn't easy to answer.  I would like to improve the quality of my life.  I wouldn't give up my job but I could reduce the working rythm. I often work fourteen hours per day without stopping the weekend. I haven't usually take a holiday.  It's too much!  If I had 1 million euros, I would travel round the world. I would often go to the restaurant with my family or with my friends.  I would regularly go to the thermal baths.  I would participate in different kinds of English trainings in private institutes in Belgium and in English countries because I would like to become more fluent.  I would sustain some human and social projects that could also aim a long term development as showed in the movie called 'Demain'.  There are the first idea's I think of doing.</answer>
