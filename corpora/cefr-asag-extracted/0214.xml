        <answer>First if I had 1 million euros, I think that I would give a part of my money to my family and to the medical research. Then, as concerned for the rest of the sum, I would keep it for me. Thanks to it, I would travel to the United States, Australia, Thailand,... with my family and my friends. Moreover, I would buy 2 or 3 cars (not specially luxuous) to be independant and  a swimming pool to enjoy the summer holidays. Finally I would go the casino for the first time of my life to have a great time with my friends but I would stop before losing all my money.</answer>
