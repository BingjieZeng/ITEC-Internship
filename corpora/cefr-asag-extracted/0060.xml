        <answer>Last year, I went in Italy with my school during 6 days. It was in April so it was warm and sunny every day. First, we went in Rome during 3 days. It's the most beautiful city that I have ever seen. We discovered a lot of monuments such as &quot;Il colosseo&quot;, &quot;Fontanta di Trevi&quot;,etc. Then, we went in Florence, another beautiful city ! We also visited a lot of things. Concerning the food, it was obviously delicious because in Italy, all is good ! This trip in Italy is my best momery of a holiday because I was with my friends and so it was very pleasant !</answer>
