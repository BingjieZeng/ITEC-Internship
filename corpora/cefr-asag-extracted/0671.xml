        <answer>I totally agree with this sentence. In fact, if you want to be fit, a balanced diet is more important than doing sport only. But being fit is not the only purpose in life. A good diet keeps you in shape, lively, awake... It brings you everything you need ( vitamins, calcium, ... ) and keeps away illness.</answer>
        <answer>It's ok to eat some fast food from time to time but it mustn't be a habit.</answer>
        <answer>Of course you have to drink a lot of water too, it's the only liquid you need to survive. It's important to avoid sodas and you need to control your alcohol comsumption. Having a balanced diet for me is to eat everything, to vary your meals, to eat a lot of vegetables, and if you can buy local products it's even better. I think that today the 'bad' food is a lot more affordable than healthy food and it's a big problem in our society. We need to change the way we buy food for us and for the planet.</answer>
