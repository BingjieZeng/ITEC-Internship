        <answer>In my opinion, the first item is more important for various reasons. The only important thing in this world, for me, is to be happy and the best way to get happiness is to do good around us. In this sense, as we spend a lot of our time at work, it seems important to me to have a job where you can realize things that can help people, in one way or another, regardless of the money you get. For me, that's the true meaning of an 'enjoyable job'. Moreover, I think that money, even necessary in our world, could be a source of a lot of suffering (interpersonal conflicts, disproportionate desire, psychological stress, divorce,...) while an enjoyable work could rather be, in one's daily life, a source of social and personal blooming.</answer>
