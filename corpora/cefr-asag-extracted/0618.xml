        <answer>I don't think so. In my opinion, study abroad should be a choice and not an obligation. It can be to much expensive for some parents to pay the travel. Of course, study abroad is a really good choice to learn a new language. However, if the goal is really to learn a new language, I think it can be succesful by an immersion for kids : there is no more efficient method to learn a language by an immersion in an english class, for instance. It's really easy for kids to learn a language because their brain is evolving.</answer>
        <answer>In conclusion, I think that study abroad should not be a compulsory part of education. However, the immersion in a class to learn a new language is, for kids, a solution that should be more implemented.</answer>
