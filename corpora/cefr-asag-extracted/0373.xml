        <answer>Do people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy ?! Of course, they do. Why shouldn't they ? Because they represent us ? Because they are public figures ? I do not agree. They sould have the same rights as any citizen, but they could, maybe, have a few more duties than the average citizen.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>The right of privacy is included in the human right charter and as far as I am concerned, politicians are also humans. So, as most of the countries in the world signed the human rights charter, almost all the countries should stick to it and enforce it ! Those men and women in the the public eye have husband and wife, children and maybe grandchildren. Why should their family suffer of untimely harassment from the medias ?</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>In conclusion, every men, women, children, etc, regardless their jobs, their race, their religion and their beliefs should have the right to privacy as well as all the others human basic rights.</answer>
