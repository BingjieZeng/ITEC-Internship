        <answer>In 2013, my partner and I traveled to Iceland for 10days. We have rent a car (Jeeps are a requirement, it can be very tricky sometimes to ride!) and move everyday from a place to another one in the South of Iceland. We have visited several amazing places. The landscape are also astonishing; sometimes, you had the feeling to be on the Moon, alone. We were also surprised by the sheeps. There are a lot of sheeps everywhere. But unlike in Belgium where they live in groups, in Iceland, they live by group of three, the mother and two baby sheeps. Everywhere, if you see one sheep, the two others are not far away! This is one of my best memories!</answer>
