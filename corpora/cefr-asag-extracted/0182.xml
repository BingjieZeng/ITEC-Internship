        <answer>I had one million euros, i would probably go on holiday in places where it's too much expensive for me now. Then I'll send a part of my money to my friends and my family. After it, I would ask to specialist of money what is important to do and not to do when you are rich. Oh yes, I would buy a new guitar. But I certainly wouldn't stop my studies which is for me more important than money. You know, when you start studies like archeology or musicology it is not on venal purpose I think.</answer>
