        <answer>I don't know what i would do with a million, but I know what i won't do with a million ! For instance, i'm sure that i won't stop working, because one million is not enough to live a comfortable life (pay your house, a car, raise childrens etc...). I think I'd rather invest this million in something like real estate. The only &quot;useless&quot; thing I'll afford with this money is probably great holidays with my friends, somewhere really far from here. But for the rest of this money, I think I'll just invest it, there's nothing more to do with this amount of money. Or maybe a fast italian sportcar, I don't know. To sum up, I think I will buy/do one thing useless with this money, and the rest is going to be in financial.</answer>
