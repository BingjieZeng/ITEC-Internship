        <answer>This is easy for me to answer the question. Because I'm not going to vacation. But I wish I could go. Ok, if I could go on vacation, I would go in the countries where there are horses and I will do of ethology with them. I would choose the USA or Venezuela. In the USA I would gather the herds of horses and take it back to the coral. Here's how I would spend the holidays.</answer>
