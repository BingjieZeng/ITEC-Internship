        <answer>In my opinion, study abroad is very important for the education. Nowadays, it's expensive to study abroad so if it's compulsory, maybe the governement would make it more affordable. Plus, in school we have only five hours of'English lessons which is not enough! At least you're immersed, it's impossible to get ou of school bilingual. Study abroad would make the young more independant, they would learn and see another culture and they would considerably improve their second language. Furthermore, more and more young people are lazy or too confortable in their routine to go study abroad by themselve but I think it's an experience which would do them good. In conclusion, study abroad should be a compulsory part of education, even if it's for a few days because the young could see something else and maybe it would make them study and learn better.</answer>
