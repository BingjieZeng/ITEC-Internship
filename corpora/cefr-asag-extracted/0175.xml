        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I would spend that money for my family first, to bring them on holiday to do a whole world travel's tour. But I suppose that I still would have money after that. That's why I would give a part of this amount of money too poor countries, so that they can build hospitals and first help's buildings. I would like to help people who is in the need, whithout passing throught their government because I know they usually are currupted.</answer>
