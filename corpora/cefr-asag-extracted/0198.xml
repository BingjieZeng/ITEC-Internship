        <answer>If I had 1 million euros I would do a lot of things with it. Frirst, I would probably think about all those things I could buy or do for myself such as buy a big house, go on holidays, buy clothes, a car, a boat and so on. But in a second time, I would of course think deeper and realize that keeping 1 million euros just for myself and my little happiness would be really selfish.</answer>
        <answer>Due to this reflexion, I would give a part of this fortune to poor countries, poor families and children; people who will need this money much more than me. Also, I would propably ground a foundation who cares about women and their children who has to run away from war or violent husband or father all around the world. I would like this foundation to protect these people and to offer them a place where they can sleep, eat, learn in schools, have drugs and medical help.</answer>
