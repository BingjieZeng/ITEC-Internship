        <answer>I am pretty sure that eating a balanced diet can bring us a healthy life. As we can see, eating junky food or fat food will make us becomming bigger and when you start in this way you may have some problems to get back. Everything will start to decline in your body. You won't make sports or physical actvities anymore.</answer>
        <answer>However, the diet is maybe not the most important factor for a healthy life. If you don't have a balanced diet but you take care of everything else in your every day life, like sports, social activites,... You won't have any problems. Because for me, your bad diet can easily be eliminated if you just go outside for a walk or something.</answer>
