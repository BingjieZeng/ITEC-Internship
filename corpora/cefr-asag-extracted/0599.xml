        <answer>It would be great to change first the vision of environment people have. All day long, we receive dozens of messages that have a negative impact on our mood: pictures of dead delphins or cutten trees produce anger, sadness, incomprehension; documentaries about our way of life (meat industry, for example) produce guilt. I don't believe in negative messages to generate positive actions. The problem is not in the way we treat environment, it's in the way we think it. We must think first about why we feel so separated from environment, then what we want to do with that relationship, and in the end what we want to change or to keep that way.</answer>
