        <answer>I think it's more important to have an enjoyable job. To make money is also important but it's not a way to happiness. I prefer to be happy by enojoying my job. Every morning, I wake up and, if I like my job, I'll be happy. If I work only to make money and to have more and more money, the wake up will be difficult and the life become without sense. But being too poor is not a solution. Sometimes we see some artists who don't have any money and become homeless. I don't want to become like that. I think everyone have to find the right mesure between earning money and having a fun or enjoyable job. Job isn't all the time fun. People talk about 'bore out' phenomenon. I don't agree with that. A job doesn't have to be interesting. The first fonction is to earn money. If I like my job, it's better but it's not an obligation.</answer>
