        <answer>I think it is really more important to have a job that we like because we spend a lot of time to work. This long time we have to be concentrated and effective with what we do. That for, we have to be motivated. And how could we be motivated if we don't like our job?</answer>
        <answer>Nevertheless, money is important also because if we don't have enought money we will have a lot of problems to eat, to pay our bills and loans, and so on. I also think that a job that make money does'nt always give a good quality of life. If it is a very stresful job with a lo of responsibilities, we will come back home stressed and tired and our job will affect our private life. With that kind of situation, we can have as money as we want, we won't be happy with our job. That can lead to a lack of motivation that breeds to a diminution of productivity and even to problem with the boss.</answer>
        <answer>It is why we say &quot;money does'nt buy happiness&quot; and why I think that it is more important to have an enjoyable job than to make money.</answer>
