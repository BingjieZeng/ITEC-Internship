        <answer>This happened about two years ago when the doctor announced me that I am pregnant. It was great! specialy because according to  some specialists I met in France earlier I was not able to give birth. During my pregnancy, everything was alright. My man and I were so happy, smiling all day long. My baby is born on september 2014, a lovely boy weighted 3,075 kg we called {name} because of the meaning of this name (God cure). He is our sun ray. I expect having another baby! maybe a girl. but if this does not happen, I am already blessed to be a mother.</answer>
