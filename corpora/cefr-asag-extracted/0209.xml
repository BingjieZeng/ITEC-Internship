        <answer>My hobby is cosplay making. This word comes from &quot;cos&quot; which means costume, and &quot;play&quot; which means you play the role of the character who wears this costume. If I had one million euros, I would probably buy a workshop where I wan create what I want, whithout being scared about making a huge mess. In fact this is a pretty dirty hobby; you need to use foams,a soldering iron, paints... Materials are also very expensive, I'm too young to afford all that I want so this million would be definetly very useful.</answer>
