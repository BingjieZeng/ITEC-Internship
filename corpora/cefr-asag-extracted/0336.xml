    <answers>
        <answer>I think study abroad is very important for the education. Students can discover a whole new culture and meet people all over the world.</answer>
        <answer>But even more, it can help students to learn a different language and to have clases en that new language. This is really interresting because they can use that language later for their jobs.</answer>
        <answer>And most of all, study abroad gives experiences. I personnaly went in Canada for an exchange program and it gave me a lot of experiences. I could learn that the culture is very different from ours, even if it is still an occidental counrty, I also learned the language very well and not to be shy when I try to talk english.</answer>
        <answer>Finally I really think study abroad should be a compulsory part of the eductaion because it brings experiences, knowledge and you meet a lot of people. This is an amazing time when you study abroad.</answer>
