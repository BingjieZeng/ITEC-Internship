        <answer>If I had 1 millions euros, I would keep a part for me and give the rest to different associations for human's right, poverty, homeless people, refugees. I think that when you keep all the money for you and that you buy everything you want, you think you're happy and the king of the world but it's not the same hapiness that when you share it with people who really need it. I think that when you share, you become richer than when you keep your money for your own pleasure.</answer>
