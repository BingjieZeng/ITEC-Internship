        <answer>The best book I've ever read is a biography of Louis de Fun√®s, the famous French actor. I know that it's not a high level of litterature, but he's one of my favourites actors. So, it was very amazing to discover his life and his career. It was a great moment and I was very passionate by the reading of this book. Soon, I'll read authors from the French litterature, who is one of the best one in the world.</answer>
