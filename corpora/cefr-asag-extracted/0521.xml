        <answer>I went to a show. A one man show, Dan Gagnon was in Belgium, it was awesome.</answer>
        <answer>And you know what? This guy made his show with nothing. He didn't ask for money and gave an envelope to people and people would put in what they want.</answer>
        <answer>If they laugh a lot, they gave a lot of money if they have a lot of money. I'm poor but if i could i'd put 500â‚¬ in this envelop because i laugh so much. I was so happy when i got out. I love this guy, you need to see him.</answer>
