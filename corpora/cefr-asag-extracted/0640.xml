        <answer>I think it's to late for the environment but the best would be to use common transports instead of autos. If the school or the work is not far from home use cycles or even by foot if it's possible. You will protect the environment but you will be in better condition too, it's killing two birds with one stone. Don't throw junk or thinks like that in the environment, because some of them take a very long time to disapear. Besides it's very awfull to see junks everywhere in the street. One other thing would be to protect the Nature, don't use a sheet of paper to write only 2 words! You can use that sheet for one other thing. Don't kill the trees. And for the politics who whant us to pay for the number of trees we have in our gardens that's the worst of all.</answer>
