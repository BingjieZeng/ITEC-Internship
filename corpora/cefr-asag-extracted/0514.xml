        <answer>The best book - not necessary the easiest - that I  have read is probably  &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; by Marcel Proust. Each knows the inimitable style of the autor who plays with all nuances of de French language. But it is overall by the description of the society  and de character that this book is remarquable. The autor observes with a great perspicacity a part of de society of this end of 19th century. He is  part of this but, at de same time, he keeps a distance with it. So, his narration looks at once well documented and objective. Besides, it is often very humorous.</answer>
