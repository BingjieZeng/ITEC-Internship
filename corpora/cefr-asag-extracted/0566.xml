        <answer>It is very difficult to determin which book is the best I have ever read because I have read many and many and I am still doing it. However, after a few minutes of thinking, I would say the Harry Potter books. First, they helped me love reading when I was a little girl. Indeed, my father &quot;almost&quot; ordered me to read at least one or two chapters everyday in order to improve my reading speed, my vocabulary and so on and so forth. When I finished the third one, I was completely in love with the books and it gave me the desire to pick up another one. Today, I have at least a hundred books at home. Second, they are my first saga so they are more precious to me than could be The Chronicles of Narnia or even The - So Precious- Lord of the Rings. Finally, we can not deny that JKR made an enormous work given that she created a world from A to Z: the characters, the places, some of the creatures, the spells, .... Her whole magic world has had a huge impact on our own one because we are using her specific vocabulary in the daily life. For instance, someone is saying to be a muggle when he or her is lacking particular skills. In conclusion, the Harry Potter books are definitely one of the best books I have ever read.</answer>
