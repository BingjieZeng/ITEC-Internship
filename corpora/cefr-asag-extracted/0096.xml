        <answer>Last winter I traveled with my mother, my sister and my brother. We were on the cruise and we visited Greece, Italy, Malta and Turkey. The boat was awesome and we met a lot of teenagers with my sister. There were Szwarovski diamonds everywhere and the boat was very luxous. I get lost a lot of times because it was so big!. I liked these two weeks, it was amazing!</answer>
