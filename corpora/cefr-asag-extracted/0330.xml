        <answer>To improve the environment is a large notion, i think however, that it is very important to find solutions in order to finght against the hight emmission of gazes causing global warming and other forms of pollution.</answer>
        <answer>I would advise everyone to start by doing little individual actions such as, recycling, using as little posible your car, investing in renouvable and alternstive energies. In the end, this matter regards each one of us. I believe that it is, with some help from governments (taxes on gaz emissions, allocations for green energy), our duty to create a demand in the market that will be strong enought to change the current narrative.</answer>
