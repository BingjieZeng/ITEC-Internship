        <answer>Every year, for 12 years, we go to the same club in Turkie. We know the animators and some customers who come every year as we. My best memory is the night of 21th July last year. We have clothes and accesories with the colors of Belgium and the atmosphere was fantastic. We always have fun there and we forget everything else.</answer>
