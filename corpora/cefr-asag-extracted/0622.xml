        <answer>It shouldn't because it's not easy for everyone to be comfortable with that. It's difficult to be away from friends and family.</answer>
        <answer>Another reason is that if the person is not very motivated to study abroad, he won't really try to speak and learn English (or another language).</answer>
        <answer>It's very important to study a foreign language, but it will be very stressfull to go studying in a foreign country and to stay in a foreign family.</answer>
        <answer>Furthermore, studying abroad has a cost. A lot of families don't have enough money to allow that. If parents have many children (for example three or more), it will cost to much to allow to all their children to study abroad.</answer>
