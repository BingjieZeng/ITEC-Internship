        <answer>In my opinion, this statement is basically true. It has been shown by several studies that malnutrition and/or one-sided nutrition is not healthy in the long run and also affects mood, motivation and wellbeeing in general. We all know that we do not feel particularly good when we eat nothing but fast-food for a week or have just devoured a complete chocolate cake. However, being obsessed about your diet, constantly thinking about it and restricting yourself too much is not healthy either. For me a healthy balanced diet means also that I can eat what I crave for. Usually, the body knows best what he wants. If you are thirsty, you drink water. If you need salt, you want to eat salty food etc. Of course, we can also not completely give in to our cravings, but it is important to find a healthy balance to achieve a healthy life-style.</answer>
