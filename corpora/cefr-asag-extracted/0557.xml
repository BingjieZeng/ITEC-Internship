        <answer>Hello dear friends,</answer>
        <answer>This morning I went to the chemistry to buy a pregnancy test because I thought I am pregnant. I didn't say it to my husband and to my parents neither but I sayed it to my best friend, {name}. So I bought this test and I did it this afternoon with my best friend because I didn't want to be alone to do it. I was so frightened the test will be negative but at the same time I was so excited. We waited for this moment for two years! When I did it, I didn't want to watch the result first so {name} did it for me. She didn't say anything for long seconds, and I said to me that it wasn't even the good moment and at the same time I begann to cry she shouted me that the test was positive!</answer>
        <answer>I was so happy and to be really sure I decided to go by my doctor. So at about 3pm he examined me and he said me : &quot;Congratulations, you're pregnant!&quot;. You don't know and imagine how I was happy.</answer>
