        <answer>I think the most important is to have an enjoyable job because the laps of time between the beginning of your carreer and your retirement is very long nowadays, and will grow in the future. So, you will have to manage all your life with a crappy stressful job.</answer>

        <answer>Of course, a few people will say that the money you earn will help you with all your problems, but I think an entire life based on money and nothing else is not really a life, there are more honorable values in our world.</answer>

        <answer>Finally, an enjoyable job where you're good at it will ensure a good carreer. In other words, you will begin low but maybe finish at the top. Just because you enjoy your job and you bring motivation in it.</answer>
