        <answer>In my opinion, having an enjoyable job is far more important than making money. Of course money is necesseray to live, to have access to good accomodation, good food and health care. But I prefer earning a little less money and being happy to go to work, because our job represents the most important part in our life time. Having the chance to work in something we like, with friendly colleagues and interresting job make us more happy, more productive and help us to grow and progress beter. I can't imagine I wake up every morning just to earn money : it's sad if it's the only purpose in life.</answer>
