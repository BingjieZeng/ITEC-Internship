        <answer>It's easy for me.I would give half of this million to my son. With the other part, I would travel around the world. There are lots of countries that I don't know I would see. I would see again a country that I like, it's Canada.But, above all, I would buy a chalet in Switzerland because it's the country I love, it's the country where I'm feeling fine.It's a country where I often went with my parents and my grand-parents when I was young and I have Swiss blood because my grand-father was a Swiss man.</answer>
