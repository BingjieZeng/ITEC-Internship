        <answer>From my point of view and my personnal experience, study abroad should be a compulsory part of education.</answer>
        <answer>I went abroad around 18 years old, during 1 month in the USA to improve my english and it was such a great experience: I improved my english, i discovered a new country/culture and i met new peoples from all around the world. Moreover I went there by my self so it's aso a great personnal challenge.</answer>
        <answer>Then 2 years later, I made an internship in London for 4 months, amazing experience too.</answer>
        <answer>And finally I did an Erasmus semester in London. Thoses 6 months in London were amazing: I was living a dream by living in my favourite city, always doing something et discovering new things everyday and meeting people.</answer>
        <answer>Those 3 experiences abroad were my choice, never in highschool/upgrade studies they suggest us to go abroad.</answer>
        <answer>But as french, the english courses in collegre, high school are not pushed and I really imporved my english by going abroad.</answer>
        <answer>So I think that the school need to propose a time abroad (from 2 weeks to severals months) to let students have this opportunity.</answer>
        <answer>Of course we need to care in consideration also the financial part...find a way that help also the one who have less revenue to have this experience, to enjoy it.</answer>
        <answer>It was the best experience i eved had, and if one day I have a child, i would like him to have this opportunity!</answer>
