        <answer>The ideal situation would be to have a nice job and to earn enough money too, but in day to day life it is extremely difficult to have both of them. So if I had to choose it would be really hard for me because we live in the consumerism era. However I like more situations when I do activities that I enjoy than making money. I never think about money while I'm working, but about objectives, about ways of improving myself in that job even if I won't be rewarded at the end. There is no difference for me of involvement in an activity if it's paid or unpaid. Therefore I suppose that my main motivation is not related to money but to the quality of my work and to my self-accomplishment.</answer>
