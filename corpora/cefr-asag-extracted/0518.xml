        <answer>Unfortunatly I am not a great reader. But I have to admit that I am quite fan of Ken Follett's books. I like the way he used to mix historical content with heat romance stories. My favorite book is certainly Jackdaws. As he used to do mister Follett create a story opposing two kind of personnality. In Jackdaws it's about a love story between a british and afrench resistant network leader. They try to disturb the German logistic by destroying imprtant points. Sometime they get captured and escaped. The magic thing in this book is the fact Ken Follett succeed to make us live the adventure in the same tme that the heroes.</answer>
