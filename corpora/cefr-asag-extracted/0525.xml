        <answer>The best book i ever read was treasure Island from Robert Louis Stevenson.</answer>
        <answer>There is now sixteen years ago. It was the first book who gave me pleasure to read. My french teacher forced me to chose a book for a work (the objectif was to read a book and make a text on it to give others want to read it) and i was not really interested in this but, after fews pages, it was a great discovery.</answer>
        <answer>First of all, i discovered how a book offers you more possibilities than films to create your own world and characters. No matter how the author could describe things, you can always imagine them as you want.</answer>
        <answer>The second point i discovered is the pirate world, The way they live and think.This stylish and highly regulated side but without concessions seduced me.</answer>
        <answer>Since this moment, i read a lot and especially books on stories of pirates.</answer>
