        <answer>Last summer I attended to a great music festival near Namur in Belgium. This festival took place in a small village so it was difficult to reach by car and a little bit disturbing for people living around. Nevertheless there were no complaining from those people. As I said it was a music festival but it had way more goals than just making discover little groups from the places around. For example one of the main line was to make people aware about the pollution made by such a big event. The association of having fun and taking care of the environnement really brought me joy all over the festival.</answer>
