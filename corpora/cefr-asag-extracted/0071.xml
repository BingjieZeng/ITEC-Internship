        <answer>I'd like to share you a funny memory about the first time I went to New York. I'm not sure I need to told you because it means I'm very bad at english. I went there to visity my girlfriend who was working as an &quot;au pair&quot;. During our stay we visited the MoMA wich is a very important building with a lot of rooms where you get easely lost. When we were looking at the pieces of Art in the garden a woman asked us the way to the exit. I decided to improve my english and I explained to her that she needed to go back inside and then turn left. I'm actually sure she did'nt understood me because she respond : &quot;ok anyway I will find by myself&quot;. I was very disapointed because I was pretty sure my english was correct and clear. That was for me an interesting holiday's memory about my english level wich is the point of this exercise.</answer>
