        <answer>3 years ago, I went to New-York in June. It was my best holiday at all because this famous city that never sleep is a wonderfull  city ! I went there with my parents and my little brother. Every morning we went to a Starbuck to eat bagels and to drink a coffee like a real New-Yorker.
