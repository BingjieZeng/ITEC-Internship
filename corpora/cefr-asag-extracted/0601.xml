        <answer>absolutely not,because such decision requires a lot of economic and financial funds ,and the main rule of education system is that it must be fair in a way to cover all the portions of the society ,beside that , we have apeople with special needs like handicaps , which is impossible to them to afford the troubles of being away from their families ,furthermore ,we have a lot of married university student and sometimes a single mothers , for those also it will be impossible to carry on  and so many other reasons , personally , with now a day communication technology , any culture could be discovered by few clicks in our pc ,laptop and even mobile , we can communicate and speak with any person at anytime and anywhere within a seconds , we can intoduce ourselves or conquer, any culture we like to know , while sitting on a chair, the world becomes a small village for humanity .......eventhough study abroad offers us a deeper  and clearer understanding of people form different background , it will give us  the real art and experience of dealing with different communities , religions ,habits and traditions ,at the end i would prefer that study abroad will continue as optional choice for everybody ....thank you.</answer>
