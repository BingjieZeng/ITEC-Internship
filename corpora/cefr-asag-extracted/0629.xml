        <answer>In my opinion, traveling abroad is the best way to learn a language. First of all, it's incredibly faster than in your own country because you have to speak non-stop in the other language. Moreover, speaking with native speakers increase your listening and speaking skills in a real conditions of living. For exemple, I went to Canada during 4 months and I learnt more than what I studied while I was at school in Belgium. So yes, if we want to increase the number of multilanguals people in Belgium, studying abroad must be a compulsory part of education.</answer>
