        <answer>Well that's a rude question! I have many books that I really enjoy reading, but if I have to choose one it will probably be &quot;Pride and prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. I'm kind of a very romantic girl, so love stories are my faves! Why I do love so much this book? First of all the character of Mr. Darcy is so interesting! He is kind of mysterious and really intrigating. On the other hand, the book is not only based upon a love story, there is so much subject that the author talks about like the gap between poor and rich poeple in the past; how they tend to live etc.</answer>
        <answer>Finally the book end in a happy way, and I love happy ends!</answer>
