        <answer>It's sure that having a healthy diet helps to have a healthy life. But for me it's not the most important factor. The way of life is the most important factor. Don't smoking and don't drinking for example are some factors whose help to be healthy.</answer>
        <answer>Sport is also very important. I think that you can eat what you want if you practice often sport. Giving a big importance to eating is not the solution.</answer>
        <answer>For me, everything is in the head. If you decide to have a healthy life, you have to practice a lot of sports and pay attention to every excess that you can make. Of course if you go very often to the fast food you won't have a healthy life but you have to find a kind of golden mean. As I said it's not the most important factor but it's still a factor. So my point of view is that sport is the most important factor for a healthy life and a balanced diet shouldn't have a lot of importance if you don't fall in the excess.</answer>
