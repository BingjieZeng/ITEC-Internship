        <answer>If i had 1 million euros, i would firstable give a part to my parents because they have been giving me a lot of money since i was born. Then i would buy a normal house and maybe a car if i still have enough money. For the house, a old house in the countryside could be great and for the car, a Clio or a small VW would be really good. One million euros is not so much in fact but it can help a lot !</answer>
