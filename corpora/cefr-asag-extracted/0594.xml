        <answer>in my opinion study abroad should be a part of education. it would bring a lot of advantages. First to study in another language. it is surely the best way of learning a language without no other option that using the four competencies of learning. Secondly to meet people from other culture, other habit, and to understand that our way of leaving is certainly common but not necessary the most appropriate and can be challenged. Finaly because of leaving, studying or working abroad obliges you to go out your day to day life and certainly to be challenged by the new situations you'll face with. It is the best way and probably the most quick way to grew up and to reach a good self confidence.</answer>
