        <answer>Yes, there should be a separation between private and professionnal life. Even tough a part of some people's job is to be famous, well knowned, and therefore being seen, they should have the right to a private life. The devellopment of their children and their couple relation might be endangered with the omnipresence of photographs and media in their life. They already have to bear this situation at their work or when they show themselves, and it's got to be enough pressure. So let them have a family life without trying to sneak in! Isn't it the first amendement of the constitution to have the right to freedom? And what freedom is greater than the freedom to be forgotten to be eyes of the others, the ones that you do not care about. And this, to be more present to those you love, because real love don't come from a horde of unknowned people! This kind of love is called &quot;admiration&quot; and this is so futile that you can lost all admiration in one time. But you will always get the love you deserve. If you deserve it!</answer>
