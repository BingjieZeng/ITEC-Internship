        <answer>I think an enjoyable job is way more important, as long as you make enough money to live comfortably. If you are not happy when you work then it is a big problem because you do your job everyday for quite a few hours and during a big period of time. Money is of course important because you need some to live, to eat, to do stuffs on the weekends... But happiness is more than that ! If you don't like your job, you come home everyday in a bad mood and that's not nice for your family, your roomates, ...</answer>
        <answer>In the end, you need both, a nice job that you like and enough money to be comfortable at the same time. If you can achieve that then it is up to you to be happy. Of course that is not accurate for everybody. Some people need more money other less. And there are less fortunate people in this world with not really one or the other but they still can be happy.</answer>
