        <answer>On the other hand, nobody can't say that study abroad won't be useful for our professional life. This kind of experience should be proposed to everybody like a normal choice between differents things in order to develop our education level.</answer>
        <answer>Finaly, it's better to let the choice to the children to choose if they want to develop their skills or not.
