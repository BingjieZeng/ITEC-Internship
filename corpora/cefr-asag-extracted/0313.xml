        <answer>I think it's better to have a enjoyable job. Why ? Because humans need to have a purpuse in their lives, and if they don't do anything, they'll get boring. Works stimulate creativity, and if this job is enjoyable to one personn, that one'll be happier and more productive than if the job is unpleasant to him.And, if this job is enjoyable to that personn, and if his salary allow him to live, I think this personn would rather have this enjoyable job than just making money, because happinness is not only a matter of money.</answer>
