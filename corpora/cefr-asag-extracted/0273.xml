        <answer>As a student, I would be really delighted if I could study abroad and discover new horizons. Travelling bring experience to the students and that can be really useful in the professional life. It gives them a new look to everyday-problem and this new look can help in future decisions making.</answer>
        <answer>But these abroad studies would have a cost some students couldn't afford. If these travels were compulsory, it would cost the student or the state. I think that nearly free education is far too expensive for the state to add travels like these.</answer>
        <answer>While studying in a foreign country is a necessary experience, it can be a real financial burden. In my opinion, making them compulsory is a bad idea but these academic travels must be facilitate for everyone.</answer>
