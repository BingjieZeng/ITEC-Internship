        <answer>Actually, i would say that you have to choose a job that you like to do. If the job makes you earn money, it's better but the enjoyable job is the right answer in my opinion. My dad is an independant artist and this question is one of the first discussion we had when I was able to. He told me that he has already been working with men who hated their jobs (but they were making a lot of money) and he could see in their faces that they weren't happy in their life. Later, when i'll get a job, i don't want to wake up every morning with a headache just to not go to my job.</answer>
