        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I think that I would turn a little bit crazy. It's difficult to keep your head clear when you own such amongst of money.</answer>
        <answer>But I would try to control myself anyway and to spend it the righter way I could. So I would begin by giving my parents the third of it, because they've always given all they had to their children and have always provided for my needs. Than I would leave Belgium with my boyfriend to go around world for one year or two and spend God knows how much of that money. At my return, I would have the house of my dreams built. And if I still have anything left of this 1 million euros, I would give as much presents as my wallet can to all the people that I care about.</answer>
