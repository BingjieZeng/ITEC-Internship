        <answer>Unfortunately, I feel like campuses aren't places for open minds anymore. In many unversities, professors share their knowledge with students without any way to encourage them to analyze, the topics they teach, with a critical approach. Indeed, campuses seemed to be places where people can exchange their opinions and reach a higher comprehension level of what surround them and see different point of views of society issues for example. Despite of a real multiculturalism in universities, lectures don't allow a relevant debate on our society.</answer>
