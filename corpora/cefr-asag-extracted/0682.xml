        <answer>As I can see it, I agree completely with the statement proposed: eating a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. It doesn't mean that it is not allowed to eat a menu as the above described, but not everyday nor everyweek!</answer>
        <answer>When we eat a balanced diet we give our organism all the vitamins, antioxidants, essential oils, ions,... that it needs without necessity of supplementary pills to improve our intake.
