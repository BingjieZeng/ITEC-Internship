        <answer>I'm keen on drawing. My passion started when I was a little girl. Despite of the years, I stil draw in my room. It's like a therapy. All stress is done. My family is proud of me and my passion for painting. But my best way to draw is with a black pencil. I enjoy to taste different kind of shadows to make it more realistic, with all the perspectives.  My favourite subjects are people. I can take one hour to make a realistic face. Eyes are the most interisting part to draw. Because of their depth power. I stil train when I have time to consacrate to it. Even if I have a good level, we have always things to learn.</answer>
