        <answer>If I had one million euros, I'll probably use it for something I care about. My first idea is to give all the money to chirldren from Africa who really need that. I think it can help them to have for example some threatments to cure them, or it can give them the  possibilty of building a school so they can have the education they deserve, as everyone does. If the money I have can make other people happier, that will be the best I can hope.</answer>
