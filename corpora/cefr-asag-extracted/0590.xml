        <answer>I'm not sure it's something necessary for everybody, it depends of what you want to do later. Some people'll never use language is theyre job and for some people, languages are boring, you may not force somebody to learn languages.</answer>
        <answer>But personally, I love languages and I want to learn it at university, so evidently study abroad is for me, I think, a compulsory part of education.   I said  that you may not force somebody to learn language, but in fact, study abroad isn't only about learning language, it's more. You discover new people, a new population, new traditions. There is something interesting in everything new, so traveling  can be interesting for everybody.</answer>
