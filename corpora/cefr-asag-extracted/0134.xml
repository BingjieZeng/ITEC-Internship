        <answer>I think I will travel the world and visit the most beautiful areas of the world. But I find that with money it's too easy. If I want more adventure I have to meet the inhabitants of the country and walk in the nature. So, I will use the money for the plane ticket's and no for luxuous hostels. I have the project to visit south America because I have many friends in these country. They will be happy to offer me a home and to show me their country. I dream to walk in the historical Machu Pichu.</answer>
