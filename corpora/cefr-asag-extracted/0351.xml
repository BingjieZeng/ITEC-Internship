        <answer>We have a lot of means to improve the environment and we have to do it ! First, we need to give attention to the use of water. We spoil it with chemical products and it's a real probleme because that kills entire ecosystem and it's the reason of natural disaster. In a second time we need to take care of our forest because that's the way of breath of the earth! And finally we could limit the use of private transport. There are other means who don't reject as much of carbon than the cars for example.</answer>
        <answer>To sum up we have a lot of ways to improve our environment but we have to convince the most of people of the emergency of the situation that's really the key point for me.</answer>
