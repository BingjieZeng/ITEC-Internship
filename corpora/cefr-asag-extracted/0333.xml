        <answer>I think that the most important is to have an enjoyable job. We spend a lot time at work during a day. So it's very important to be happy at work because that has a big influence on your life. If you get stress at work you will not have nice moments with your family or your friends. But money is also important because you need to earn enough money to enjoy your life and even if money doesn't bring happiness it contribute to it. So you need to find a job that you like but it also must have a great remunerartion otherwise you can stay at home</answer>
