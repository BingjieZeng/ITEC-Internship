        <answer/>
        <answer>Indeed, social networks have made real human contacts less frequent since it is now possible to be connected without being in front of each other. People tend now to chat online instead of go visiting their friends of contacts. They prefer now the internet to communicate rather than have a face to face conversation. As a result, people tend to stay at home and don't go see their good or old friends anymore, they just keep in thouch via social networks. That proves well social networks have benefits but that proves also that people should be carefull not to use them too often.</answer>
