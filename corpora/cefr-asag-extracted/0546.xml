        <answer>I actually didn't read much book. I think the better one I read is maybe &quot;La nuit des enfants rois&quot;. Cause it's a project in the futur who's take the most intelectual childrens from China to make an experience with them. This experience is to see if they are different then the average people or not and if they can actually make a better world then the one we made. I have been interesting about the story and I tried to imagine if this could be possible right now or not really. And I made the conclusion for myself that it could be interesting to try it now and see what's happening later or if they will find something together.</answer>
