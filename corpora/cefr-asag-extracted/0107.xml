        <answer>During the holiday I saw my best friend, we went shopping and we bought few clothes for summer. We took a lot of funny pictures of us. It was a beautiful day because there was sun. We saw two movies at night. Few days later I saw my cousin, she is like my sister, I can see her just two or three times by year so I was very happy. She stayed just one day but it was so good to see her even if it was too short like everytime.</answer>
