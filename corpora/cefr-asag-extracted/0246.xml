        <answer>I think it's difficult to know what are the feelings when we win such a big amount of money. People around you are jealous and probably a lot a them you didn't know before become your friend. I think it could be beter to don't say we have won/earn. If I had 1 million euros, first, I would ensure my family's wealth. After that, I would make some donations to improve sciences or poor countries devloppment. When we live without money problems, we are less concerned by work and by loan, we can take a part-time job and be more free to do more leisure. I would also spend more time with my family and try to support them but I don't want to spend my money in bets, in cars or in big house: one of the most important thing in the life is to stay ourself.</answer>
