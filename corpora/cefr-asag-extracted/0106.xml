        <answer>Thank you for your invitation! If you want, i can help you to prepare your home! I can too bring somes alcohols, food and friends. You don't have enough friends to bring a good ambiance to your party, that's terrible! So i can help you in that way, i know that you need me for this! Maybe you will meet news peoples, that can be awesome for you. I know that you're very lonely, but don't think too much about that. You just need to feel the present as he comes to you. Don't be angry when you read this, that was a whole joke! I know that you don't love this kind of humour, but i'm like that. And please, don't get wasted like the last time we had a party, you was totally drunk and you wanted to date {name}, this ugly pig! No, i'm not rude, she's really the ugliest thing on earth, and she's not a good girl. She's a whore! Excuse me, but you know that i'm right! Anyway, i just wanted to thank you and give my help.</answer>
