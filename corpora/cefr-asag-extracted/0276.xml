        <answer>Yes, i think that it should be mandatory because we have to be immerse in another country to learn well the language. Learning a language in our country is not enought, we just have more or less 4 hours at the university, so really not enought to be fluent. Nowadays without the capacity of speaking others languages, it's almost impossible to find a job. Furthermore, going overseas is a way to improve the language but it also a way to learn to be ressourceful, responsive and blooming. It's also an great opportunity to meet people from different cultures, and to discover their cultures.</answer>
