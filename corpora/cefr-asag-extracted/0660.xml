        <answer>I don't totaly agree with that point of view. For sure, eating a balanced diet is necesary for a healthy life, but it is not enough.</answer>
        <answer>Sport is very important too. It is not necessary to work out intensivly but people need to be moving. It is very unhealthy to stay sit all day long, even if you have an healthy diet. Scientists found out that staying sit all day long is very dangerous and that it kills a lot of people every year, just like smoking !</answer>
        <answer>Moreover it is also very important not to party too much, not too drinkg too much alchool.</answer>
        <answer>According to me, an other important factor is the way you feel inside. For an healty life, you got to feel good in your head, to be happy, to be possitive and to enjoy life.</answer>
