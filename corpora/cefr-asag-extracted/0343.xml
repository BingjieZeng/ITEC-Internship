        <answer>According to me, make money is a great thing to make a comfortable life and in this way, contributes to the happiness of peoples. Nevertheless, it's useless to have a painful job even if we earn a lot of money. It's very important to be well-rounded at work if we want to live harmoniously, constructively and happily. It could be fine to strike a tradeoff between an enjoyable job and a convenable salary in order to find the right balance bewteen both. To sum up, make money is a goal of life but not the first one to my mind.</answer>
