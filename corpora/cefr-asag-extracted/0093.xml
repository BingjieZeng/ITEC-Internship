        <answer>I went in France with friends last year. The destination was on an island so we took the car and the boat to go there. We loaned a big house for 9 days. We didn't have a swimming pool but the beach was 500 meters away. We had also a little car to go shopping or else. During the trip we took sunbathes, we played football, we visited the area... and we drank beers of course. We spent very good times there.</answer>
