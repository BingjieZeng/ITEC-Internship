        <answer>Last year we went on holiday in France by car with my wife my sister in law and her husband. We were in the south where the sun was often over there. It was of the first of september when there were only a  few tourists. We visited the Perigord during ten days. Usually we walked in the small villages to discover the castels and the site where the view was beautiful. The evening we choosed a typical restaurant where the crowd was limited. The come back by car was  soft and the night was marvellous.  I hope you will understand what i wont explain to you.</answer>
