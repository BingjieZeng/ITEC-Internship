        <answer>I wish I could work in a hospital that I like. Work with passion and determination. My dream is to help people. I wish that I have 2 children.  This is not easy to imagine my life in 10 years. I can't imagine myself in next month so all that I can imagine is that I'm a happy woman.   I think that I will live in a great house. I imagine myself see different countries and see many places. All I want is health, wealth and happiness for my family and myself.</answer>
