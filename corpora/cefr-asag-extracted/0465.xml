        <answer>Last summer I spend a few days in Venice with my husband and a couple of friends. It was very interesting. We stay three nights in a beautiful hotel. We visit the San Marco Place, the Rialto Bridge, the Murano Island and all the little streets around. They are very charming ! We also have very good meal in little typical restaurants. We hope really that we can return once !</answer>
