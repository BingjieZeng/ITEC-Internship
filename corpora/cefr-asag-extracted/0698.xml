        <answer>My opinion is that there are MANY factors responsible for being healthy or not. In order to be healthy one needs to pay close attention to one's life habits: eating well but also getting enough sleep, having regular exercise, drinking enough water and avoiding excessive consumption of coffee, alcohol or tobacco. Being satisfied with your life, especially as concerns the relationship(s) and professional areas, is also extremely important. So I tend to disagree with the above sentence as it tends to give the impression that eating healthily is (almost) enough, while I believe what makes one healthy is the right (and balanced: &quot;Who lives without folly is not as wise as (s)he thinks&quot;) combination of factors.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>So if someone has many good habits but does not eat very healthily, that person might well be healthier than someone who eats very healthily but does not sleep enough, is not happy with one's life and generally speaking has a high level of stress.</answer>
