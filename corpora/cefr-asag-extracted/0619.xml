        <answer>In my opinion, having an enjoyable job is really more important than making money in a human being life. On the one hand, doing things we like during job hours allows us to feel fulfilled because what we do will have more sense, and finding sense in life for a human being is the ultimate quest. On the other hand, be focused on making money in our job does not necessarily make someone happy, because being in this perspective brings a lot of stress, a lot of competition and a the end a lot of selfishness, things that are in my opinion incompatible with a happy life.</answer>
