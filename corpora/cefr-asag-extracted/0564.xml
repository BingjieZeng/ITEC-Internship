        <answer>Les chevaliers d'Emeraude because I like fantasy things and this saga was with me for years. It's not one book who after 300 pages it's the end, you can imagine some incredible beast, races, landscape who in reality never exist. Also there is so many war with weapons, magic and this war I like that. In finish It's a book who can you exit of the reality to a imagine world. Before that I had never really read, just for school, but this,had open my mind of the universe of the books. The book come from Canadian women so he is in french whrote.</answer>
