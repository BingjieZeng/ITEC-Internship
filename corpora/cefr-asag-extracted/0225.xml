        <answer>I don't read a lot of book, and when I do, they come from the shool, so I don't have the choice to read them or not. The last book I read was particularly great. It was not a book coming from the school, but a friend of mine gave me during my travel to USA. He was my host father and gave it to me to practice my english. The book was called OUTLIERS. I don't remember the autor. I thaught it was an interesting book because I could understand a lot about the american culture and they way to think, like for exemple capitalism.</answer>
