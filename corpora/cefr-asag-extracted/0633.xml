        <answer>In general and especially in Belgium, be opened to different languages is really important.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>Belgium is a trilingual country. But a lot of belgian people are not familiar with the three languages. &quot;False immersion&quot; in a school based in its own village or its own city is quite artificial. And until studying abroad is not compulsory, it would be a kind of leisure for some students.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>So I think that real scholar programmes with immersion already in other regions inside the country and also outside the country would be very profitable for everybody.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>Be opened to foreign languages, other cultures, other mentalities, other uses, other environments is an important part of education, a way to grow up and to understand the world.</answer>
