        <answer>It was two years ago... I went in India with three of my friends, it was very hot. We saw a lot of palace, we visited a nature reserve but weren't see tigers. We went in north of India and walked in mountains. We stopped to the pakistan border and saw the India-Pakistan border ceremony. It was unbelievable. We had a lot of chance thanks to the indian friend of my friend who showed us his country!</answer>
