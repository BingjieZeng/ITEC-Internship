        <answer>If i had 1 million euros, i would travel around the world. I would go to Japan, the land of my dream. I would meet different population and learn about their culture, visit all this land, from tokyo to the Fuji Mountain. I would taste the real asian food who is very different than our european's food, more fresh and more healthy. Obviously, i would take someone with me because an experience like this cannot be the experience of a unique man !</answer>
