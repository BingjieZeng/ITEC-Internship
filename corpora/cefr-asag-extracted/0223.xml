        <answer>The best book I have ever read is the book &quot;Hunger Games Part 1&quot;. I saw first the film and I liked them so much. So I would read them. In fact, I read them in one day. I like books that provide the film because I can compare the booth. I spend more time to read a book than to watch a film. So, the pleasure stay more time. I can imagine in my head the film. I sometimes read other book, that don't provide a film.</answer>
