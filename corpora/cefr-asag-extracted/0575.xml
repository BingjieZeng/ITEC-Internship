        <answer>A few days ago, I went to the old Brussels, in the Marolles to attend a play in the La Samaritaine. It's an antic cellar of the17th century with a typic entrance through a low door. The play titled &quot;When Fatima wants to be named Sophie&quot; fue written by an author iraquie, Ali Bader who lives in Belgium. I enjoyed a lot this evening with my friends and family in the quiet atmospher of the capital  in spite of the nivel 4 in relation to the security. Before the play, we have eated in a small libanese restaurant. More later in the night, we drived the 160 KM to go home. A good memory.</answer>
