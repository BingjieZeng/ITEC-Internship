        <answer>The best book I've ever read is &quot;Because I love you&quot; of Musso who is one of the best writter up to me. His litterature is not the same as Voltaire or any of these big writters but I really like the fact that everybody can read what he does.</answer>
        <answer>The book that I am talking about is a book which anybody can read. The story is a miggle of love story and drama. The way he is writting gives the story something so special that you don't even want the book to finish.</answer>
