        <answer>Hello!</answer>
        <answer>The best book I have read is : &quot;Le pouvoir du moment pr√©sent&quot;. When I was in a difficult moment of my life, a friend tald me to read it. It is not possible to read this book from the beginning to the end,  you need to stop and to let it come inside of you.It gives you another way to be in your life : the past is finished, the futur is unknowed, only what you live now is important. After reading this book, I followed a workshop about mindfullness, to learn with severals exercices to give more attention at my live : what does I feel, what does I think, what is good for me or not.</answer>
        <answer>I would like to tell also that when I was 18, I have read a book from Somerset Maugham in english for school. I Founded it pleasant and I am always proud of that!</answer>
