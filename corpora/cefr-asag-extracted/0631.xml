        <answer>In my opinion, learning abroad helps a lot to study a language, and open the mind. But it's not so easy for everybody. And it's not compulsory to go far away. In Belgium we should learn a few months in Flanders for a French speaker, and learn in Wallonie for a Dutch speaker for example. I know some people that have done it and they told me it was an extra experience! I'm sure, if I should go for a month in America, when I come back I will have improved a lot my English speaking! But, we cannot oblige people to send their children abroad, it will cost too much. Perhaps we could create some classes with foreign teachers; as we do next to the language borders..</answer>
