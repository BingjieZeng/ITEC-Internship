        <answer>For me, the most important think is to have a job you enjoy. Sure the money is not a little part of it and if you need it, it's also important..I certainly prefer a job with a correct environement, a kind atmosphere, lots of nice people and a very interesting job. To be your self and also to work correctly in a place you appreciate. But what is for you an &quot;enjoyable job&quot; ? Could you tell me more about it ? I also need your interpretation : I suppose here it's not only a survey but also an exercise to practise your favorite language ! Can I have an answer ? Thanks a lot for your response,</answer>
