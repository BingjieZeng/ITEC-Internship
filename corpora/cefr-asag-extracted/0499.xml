        <answer>Hello, I've just received your invitation and I wouldn't miss it for the world! Thanks a lot!! I know organising a party can be difficult: there is so much to plan, to think of... So if you need my help, don't hesitate to ask. I could for example come tomorrow morning to help you with the decoration, or run errands for you this afternoon. Let me know ;) Bye!!</answer>
