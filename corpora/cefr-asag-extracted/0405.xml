    <answers>
        <answer>In order to take a stance on that statement, it is necessary to give a more accurate definition of the word &quot;privacy&quot;. According to me, the right to privacy relates to the possibility, not of hiding some of our actions, but to be able to live without having  judging eye following us in our thoughts and deeds.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>With that in mind, it can possibly be stated that privacy is a necessary condition for freedom. It is indeed very unlikely to feel totally free while knowing everyone is watching. Consequently, I think this right has to be granted to every single human being, even to those whose lives are relentlessly exposed to the public.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>Furthermore, I think popular people should be able to decide wheter they some bits of their lives to be made public or not. In our communication-based society where scandals are a very profitable resource, it is of course more and more difficult for those people to keep the most private areas of their life away from greedy journalists looking for their next juicy headlines.Therefore, I think some ethical charter of journalism must be set up to prevent those people to have their lives outrageously exposed and (mis)judged by the public.</answer>
