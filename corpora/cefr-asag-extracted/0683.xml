        <answer>According to me social networks have a huge impact on our relationships. Many people nowadays have access to social media and use it to communicate and we can all say that communication is a basic thing for every relationship.</answer>
        <answer>Is that bad ? Well, that's complicated. Like everything social networks have positive and negative impacts.</answer>
        <answer>Let's start with the positive (yeah, I'm a positive person) ! When I like a person, I always want to talk with that person (logical) and social networks like Facebook make tat so easy because it's totally free and you can chat super easily on lots of devices. You can also share pictures or anything you want so people ave news from you(even if they don't contact you) and that's different from before.</answer>
        <answer>But that sharing thing is also delicate because it can leads to jalousy. I know so many people who had an argument because of some pictures they saw on Facebook !</answer>
