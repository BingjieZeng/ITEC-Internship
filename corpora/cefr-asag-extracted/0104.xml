        <answer>Four years ago, I went to Senegal during two short weeks and I think it was the most beautiful travel that I've made in my life. I took the plane and it was the first time for me because my parents doesn't like plane (my mother is afraid by that). It was the most beautiful travel because I discover a lot of thing that we doesn't know here in Belgium.</answer>
