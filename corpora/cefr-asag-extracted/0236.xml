        <answer>I read a lot of good books and I don't know which one is the best, but I remember that when I was sixteen, my favourite book was &quot;Les chroniques du monde émergé&quot;. That's a fantastic world with a struggle of power. A tyran has the power on a big territory and wants to kill everyone to late a better world growing after. The main character is a girl, not totally human, who wants to be a figther on a dragon. This book is really well written and maked me feel the emotions. It's a strong story, where the main thematics are develloped, like love, death, determination, war, pain...  It's not a shame for me to say that I cried, it's the oppisite because it proves how intensive the book is. What I like in a book is the fact that the author tells us his vision of the world throug a beautifull story, and this book do it very well, there is a true reflexion and a story from which we can't go out.</answer>
