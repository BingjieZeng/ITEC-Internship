        <answer>I've just finished to read the book entitled &quot;A new earth&quot;, a Eckhart Tolle's book translated in French. I find that it's the most interesting book that I've ever read until now because it deals about spirituality and personal development's stuff which have always interested me. I think these subjects can be very helpfull to everyone in their daily life. For example, it helps me a lot to improve myself to become happier and it works ! I've became aware of my ability to destruct myself which made me unhappy. I've understood the advantages that everyone has to enjoy life's little things and above all the fact that I can choose to change my life and make dreams come true if I really want to. All of this explanation isn't a fantasy or unreal at all. I lived some experiences that have been &quot;confirmed&quot; by this book and I am truly convinced that the whole humanity have the power to change some things if people want to live &quot;better&quot; or become happier.</answer>
