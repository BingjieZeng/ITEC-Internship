        <answer>1 million euros is a lot of money. But is it really enough to satisfy all of my dream? And after that to help me keep living a good but modest life? I don't think so. Money can be spent in a really fast way despite having a very large amount.</answer>
        <answer>That's why, I think that if I had 1 million euros, I will begin to invest a large part of it in different field. Like in real estate, stock exchange or investing in big company. Then I will save another part of the money on a saving account for me and my parents for when they will be old. Then I will use the remaining part for me, for being able to continue my scholarship without any money problem's and to be able to travel from time to time.</answer>
