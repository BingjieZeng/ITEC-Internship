One day we visited a wonderful temple. The particularity of this temple is that ther were monkeys. But this monkeys were educated by dishonest men. This men had learned to the monkeys to stole the glasses of the tourists and then to render the glasses in exchange of a snoop. Then the dishonest mens asked money to the tourist in exchange of his glasses. That arrived to my aunt who didn't hold her glasses.</answer>
