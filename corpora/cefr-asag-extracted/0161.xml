        <answer>If I had 1 million euro, I would probably save it and keep it for later. First I would finish my studies and then I would use some to travel all around the world and create a lot of souvenirs. When I will be older and more mature, I would take a part of the money to buy a house or just to invest in a important project. Altough, I would certainly donate a part to an association which helps poeple or animals.</answer>
