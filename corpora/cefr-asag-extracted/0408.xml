        <answer>Some people argue that a balanced diet is the most important factor for a healthy life. I believe it's mostly true to say that, nevertheless I don't think the factors can be organised to least important to most important.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>First of all, it is very important to eat healthy, because your body needs different kind of nutrients that cannot be find in junk food. &quot;You are what you eat&quot;, goes the saying.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>Secondly, it mainly depends on the quality of each factor. What do you call a balanced diet? Does it need to have vegetables and meat, is it opposed to fat and fast foods or does it need a bit of these?</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>Then, factors tend to be correlated with one another. If you have a healthy diet, it's probably because you care about your well-being, than you probably work out and sleep correctly. If these factors are correlated it's hard to say whether one or the other is more important.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>To conclude, a balanced diet is something subjective, some people may think eating junk food once a week may be fine while others find it way too much. How to measure what impacts your health the most, if all the factors are correlated, it's a tough question and very subjective in my opinion.</answer>
