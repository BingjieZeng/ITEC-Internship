        <answer>Last night i went to an event called &quot;Spring Tech Edition&quot; organised by the Kot &amp;amp; Mix which rassembled many techno Dj's.</answer>
        <answer>The price was as low as 3 euros even though they had booked some pretty famous artists.</answer>
        <answer>Let me tell you, the music was so great that i found it hard to even go out for a minute to get some fresh air. The sound quality was flawless, there were great visuals, the place was nice and overall, everything was well organised.</answer>
        <answer>Unfortunately, there was not as many people as the Kot &amp;amp; Mix crew predicted, my guess is that the bad weather was a turn off for some of them. Nonetheless i'm sure everyone, from the dj's to the people dancing had a great time there.</answer>
        <answer>I do hope that the Kot &amp;amp; Mix crew planned to throw more parties like this one because it's a great step back from the mainstream scene and a way to enjoy lesser known artist's music.</answer>
