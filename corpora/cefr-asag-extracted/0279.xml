        <answer>Yes I think that it should be a compulsory part of education.</answer>
        <answer>First, I think that when we discover a new country that offers a better education, it can enable us to improve our skills and then I think that it can be a good way to find a job that we're looking for.</answer>
        <answer>Secondly, I'd like to speak about my personal experience abroad that is a good example to show that studying abroad is a good way to learn. I had the opportunity to study abroad and it was a really good experience that I won't forget. I had to deal with another culture, another language that I wasn't used to. It really opened my mind, I also met a lot of people from all around the world. Studying abroad is a real asset because we discover some things about ourselves that we wouldn't have discovered if we had stayed in our country. In fact, I learn how to be more independent, self-confident and that the world has to offer us a lot of great opportunities of work.</answer>
        <answer>To conclude, I think that now and especially because of the globalization, it's important to develop our talent abroad. The world and particularly universities of the world can offer us a good opportunity to learn differently than our Belgian system of education. In my opinion, studying abroad can help us to have a positive impact on the economy and on the cultural diversity.</answer>
