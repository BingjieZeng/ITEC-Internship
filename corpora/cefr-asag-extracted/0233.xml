        <answer>Hi everyone,</answer>
        <answer>Last week there was an event on League of Legend. This event was a very big one. More than 2 billion people participated. First, I was like &quot;waow there is a lot of people who participate !!&quot;, but when I saw the rewards for the event, I was more like &quot;not so much finally&quot; because the rewards where 2.000 Â£ and a lot of other things like travel and so on. Un fortunatelly I didn't win anything because I'm not very good at that game but one of my friend who played a lot was in the top 10. So he was very happy because of all of the rewards he won.</answer>
        <answer>I hope that you played too and won a fun reward.</answer>
        <answer>See you all next week for my next article.</answer>
