        <answer>&quot;Central Park&quot; is my bestseller . This book is wrote by Guillaume Musso, an french autor. Actually I hate read books, but for this book, it was different. I began to read it last summer because my mother and brother had red it and they spoke about it all the day. This is a triller so, when I began to read it, after two pages; I would know the end of the story. This was the first time that I had this emotions when I read something. Since I have red this book, I read more and more books. When I have had a bad day, I think it's nice to sit, read and relax.</answer>
