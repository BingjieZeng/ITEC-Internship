        <answer>If I had one million euros, I think that maybe I'll move to another country, somewhere more sunny ! Of course I will still study at the university and I could afford the best helps that exists to succeed, because now I'm actually not so rich and I don't wanna ask my parents to lend me money, I'm not comfortable with it.</answer>
        <answer>I won't give money to some charity because we can never truly know what the money is really used at. I'd rather be helping others to improve themselves than only giving them money and just let them spend it.</answer>
        <answer>With the money left, I'd like to save it offshore, I heard it has become a trend. Maybe in Panama.</answer>
