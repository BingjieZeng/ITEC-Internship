        <answer>I totally agree with that concept. In your life everything as to be balanced. Who said that a good burger was not a delicious thing when you're super hungry after a busy day? Who said you can't eat sweets, candies, ice creams, pastries when you just want to? All those things definitely aren't forbidden to eat, but people need to realize they have to do it with balance. Burger? Yes, but not everyday. Ice cream? Once a week maybe. Balance what your body needs or not. Take a little of the things that are &quot;not so good&quot;, and thye won't affect your body that much.</answer>
        <answer>Just as the well-known &quot;diet food&quot;, such as salads, fruits, veggies... They are good for your body of course, but not if you eat them in big quantities. Eating only fruits and vegetables just because you want a flat belly doesn't make sense: your body is not used and acclimated to eating one type of aliment. You should diverse what you eat.</answer>
        <answer>They key to a healthy life is eating everything, from junkfood to diet and light food; but eating a little bit of each of them.</answer>
