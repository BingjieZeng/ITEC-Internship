        <answer>Privacy is a big issue for everyone nowadays but famous people certrainly have it the roughest due to the fact that they have many fans who want to keep up with their idols. However privacy is something everyone should have a right to, famous or not. It can be both taxing and frustrating for a person to be in the spot light day in and day out, expecially when it comes to pop stars for example. Having to work hard to please the fans and fight for a moment of privacy and relaxation while being hunted down by the paparazzi can be tiring and can sometimes even lead to the artist in question succumbing to depression and turning to drugs. Some time ago a famous Youtube-based entertainer had his cell phone number leaked to the public which resulted in him ceaselessly receiving calls from fans, ending with him having to change his number. The attention that overly obsessed fans pay to stars can sometimes turn into harassment and can have negative effects on their health. The well-being of a person should always be placed first. No matter who you are, you're entitled to your privacy!</answer>
