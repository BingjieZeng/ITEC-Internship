        <answer>I have red a lot of fantasy book in my life. I like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Dwarfs.... But my favorite book is in an other genre. It's a Stephen King Book. I red the Tommy Knockers (3 volumes) in one week. For me it's the best book I have ever read. Why ? Simply because the skills to tell simply the things of the author are awesome. He uses simple words and He doesn't hesitate to use some bad words. Theses bad words make a better ambiance and a more realistic scene. In this story, there is a lot of suspense... You don't know before the reading what happend in the next page. I was reading every word with my eyes big opened waiting the rest of the story with impatience.</answer>
