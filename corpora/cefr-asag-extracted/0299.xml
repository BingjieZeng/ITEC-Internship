        <answer>Studying abroad is a good way to broad our horizons and could therefore be part of education. But it can also be not as good for the students as we think.Therefore, I will explain my arguments in favor of studying abroad.</answer>
        <answer>First, international education provides different languages to the students. Indeed, they will be able to convers in English and others languages. It can be also a good oportunity to put in practice their lessons and on a resume, it can be very interesting.</answer>
        <answer>Secondly, I would say that study abroad is a perfect oportunity to keep a open mind. In fact, with a international experience, students will have another academic point of vue and listening to other teachers during a short time can be very usefull.</answer>
        <answer>Moreover, on a extra-ademic point of view, studying in a other country for a few months, during a exchange program Erasmus for example, can also be benefic, students will make a lot of new friends and they will also be more independent.</answer>
        <answer>As a conclusion, even if this program can be difficult and needs a lot of courage, I think that studying abroad needs to be a part of education thanks to all those benefits.</answer>
