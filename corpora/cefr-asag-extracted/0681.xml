        <answer>Nowadays there's nothing easier than staying in touch with people thanks to social networks. Just a few clicks and a little typing and you can say hello to your friends and make them remember that you don't forget them (even if they live in another country and you can't see them very often). You could also text them but social networks are free and now, seriously, who doens't have a smartphone ? With social networks you can also find back people you were with in high school and see what's going on with their lives. It's easy, cheap and it doesn't take a lot of time. Because, everybody knows that the lack of time is a commmon syndrom from our society...</answer>

        <answer>Even if social networks can improve relationships and make them last, they unfortunately also have the power to destroy them. How ? Words. When you're hidden behind a screen, it's easier to say things that you would never say in real life. People sometimes forget that they're actually talking to other real people because they don't see their face and their reactions. Who has never read some mean and disrespectful comments on Facebook ?</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>In 2016, we can say that social networks take a big place in our daily life. People are ultra connected between them all the time. That's why we can affirm that social networks have a big influence on relationships. I think that that influence's going to change again for the years to come because the actual trend's never going to stop to evolve. Anyway respect is the key to keep nice and positive relationships.</answer>
