        <answer>I don't really know what I'll do with 1 million euros. I would probably put a part of it in a association like Oxfam. And the other part I would use it to buy a fly ticket in order to go in a humanitary travel. Yes, I think I'll do that, because I don't need that much money. I already have everything I need. I would love to do that! I am probably the only one who would do that, but I don't care.</answer>
