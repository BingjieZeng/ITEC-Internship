        <answer>We could use more sustainable energy as wind , photovoltaic panels and biogas ( for the public transports) for instance, that will be reduce also the price of fees. People could use bike for small distances and ask for carpooling instead of using their car alone. The governments should use alternative energy like the biomass for district heating as in Vakjo (Sweden) where autorities use mostly wood chips from forestry holding but I understand that not every countries have the same resources, so it'll not fit everywhere. I think we really should study the geography of our own country because it's the best way to find in which renewable energy we could improve the technology, and then allow to reach a better sustainable development.</answer>
