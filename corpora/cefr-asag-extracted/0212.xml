        <answer>This book have really stopped my mind, first because of the writting is really matching with my thinking way, and second because the story is really about hard emotions and incomprehension, and deep passion for dance. The character is a really interested psychological person. At the end of that book she have to stop dancing because she stopped eatting to be on the body norms, but she broke her leg because of that weakness to do not eat. This story will always stay in my mind. And I was a teenager when i read this for the first time. So, that gave it even more sense.</answer>
