        <answer>My favourite book that I read is Harry Potter. This book mixed adventure, mysterious stories and a lot of different character in a fabulous and imaginative world. If I had to think about reading any story, I will think about a world similar that Poudlard of J.K Rowling. A dimmensionnal passage between two worlds in the same place on the same moment fascinate me. And think about fantasia in this second world betwitches my imagination. Launch spells, have mysterious abilities, make himself otherwise in a other world is exciting! And so, I like de competition between the four houses of students: each house brings competitivity between the groups of similar student.</answer>
