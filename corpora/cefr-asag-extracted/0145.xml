        <answer>I have already read a lot of book in my life. In my opinion, the best book is the Harry potter because there are more than one book for reading the full story. Moreover we can see after reading the book the film in cinema. It's really exciting  to read a book and imagine the situtation and the figurants. Then you can go to cinema and you can see how the productor wanted to show us the story of Harry potter. The goal of this book it's not to touch people or realise of a problem in the life but it's a funny book that you can read for your free time.</answer>
