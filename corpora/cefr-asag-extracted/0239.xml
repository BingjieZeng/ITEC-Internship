        <answer>If I had 1 million euro, I would first give money to associations against cancer or associations like &quot;les restos du coeur&quot; because I think it's very important to help people in the need.</answer>
        <answer>Also, I would give a part to my family to help them to achieve their dreams.</answer>
        <answer>And in my case, I would travel to see the differents wonderful landscapes all around the world and maybe buy a house in south America.</answer>
        <answer>But in reality, I think money is not the best way to be happy. Money can not buy happiness, so... I don't have other idea of what I would do with it.</answer>
