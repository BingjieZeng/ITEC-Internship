We began run go to De Hann, about 20 km, it was very wind but not rain. It was difficult, after 2 hour, the fist step was completed. For the 2de day, we ran 10 km go to Oostende, the sun was present. We at in a restaurant and we took a nap on the beach. Then, we gone to Middelkerke, the step for this day. It was very hot and we had pain in our legs.
