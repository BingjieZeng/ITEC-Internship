        <answer>Well, it depends on several factors like your age, your diploma's and your financial situation. If this is your first job, and you are financially safe, you need to learn a maximum of new things. Therefore I would recommend you select a job where you can get the most experience from and where you also enjoy yourself. If you are 35 years old, for example, alone with three kids, you might have to give more importance to the revenue you can get from a job rather than the content of the job although I also believe that if you are not happy with your job, this will affect your health, first your mental and then physical health conditions. At the end of your career, when you have had the chance to gather enough money and when money is no longer an issue, I would definitely go for fun in my job or at least a job that I do like where I can still learn and teach others.</answer>
