        <answer>The best book I've ever read is &quot;2015 to 2060&quot; . At first, it's introduced by telling the story of every main characters, their habits, their childhood, their job etc.. And then obviously there's a main story, with &quot;good&quot; characters and villains. But the most important in this masterchief is the evolution, indeed, it's awesome because we can see how the characters and the situation of the city evolved. Sometimes it was pretty stunning because we weren't waiting for that, but other times we were right about the guessing and we happy because we see us as a seer. Finally, it's also great because we can discover new technologies and new habits of the people, for example they don't eat breakfast anymore.</answer>
