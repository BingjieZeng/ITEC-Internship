        <answer>The first advice I would give is to never ever throw any garbage in the nature because even one plastic bottle abandoned in the forest is very disgusting and harmful to the environment.</answer>
        <answer>The second advice would be to separate the papers from plastic in your bin. That way, trashes can be recycled an get a second life. Otherwise they will be burned and that's going to spread out a very toxic smoke which is hardocre for the environment.</answer>
        <answer>And finally, the third and last advice is to try to take a look at the labels of the product you buy to see if they come from your country or if they have been imported from far away. I think that if everybody paid attention to buy local product in priority it would be helpful to the environment because one merchant ship is way more polluting than a lot of cars.</answer>
