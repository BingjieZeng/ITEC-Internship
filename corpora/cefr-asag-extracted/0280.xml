        <answer>We often ear our parents or friends saying &quot;money is not a warranty of happiness&quot;. You wouldn't dare to say that to a homeless man begging for money on the pavement. On the contrary, there are so many wealthy lonesome people only asking for a loving wife, a sweet home and friends. I think money is not a warranty but a condition to be happy.</answer>
        <answer>It sounds a bit too sentimental but some people are too focused on their professional career and forget to enjoy their youth or even their life.</answer>
        <answer>In conclusion, money doesn't make happiness but it truly helps.</answer>
