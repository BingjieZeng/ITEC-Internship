        <answer>I tend to think that people who live in the public eye have a right to privacy to a certain extent. In fact, this is their choice to show them as celebrities. Consequently they choose to show a part of their life to the public. As a result, they must not be surprised to be followed by paparazzis who always want to have a good scoop about them. But there are limits on this  celebrity.</answer>
        <answer/>
        <answer>In fact, everybody has the right to privacy when they want to keep something secret. We can't expose the whole life of somebody without his agreement, only to make money. This is why a part of their life must be private and nobody should negociate whit that. That is a simple rule of respect to the privacy of someone.</answer>
