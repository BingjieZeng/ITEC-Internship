        <answer>I don't think to make money is more important than have an enjoyable job. In our society, money is the most important thing. People are living to earn money, to make money and to dispence money. They even have a value. I don't think it's right because I think a person (whoever he/she is) is more than a number in dollar. I think a person should be respected, loved and helped in case of need. So I think money is not the more important think in life, I'd like to think their rights, their joy, their happiness is the most important thing and should be the objectif of a society, wich is saddly not the case of our society. So I think the same for a job. An enjoyable job is more important because happiness is the most important thing in life and you can't be happy if your job is not enjoyable, even if you earn a lot of money.</answer>
