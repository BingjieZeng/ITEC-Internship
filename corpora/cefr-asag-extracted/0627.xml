        <answer>Good question. The best will be to have both, an enjoyable job and a correct money revenue. We can say that the old habits, our parents and all the old system always put money like a carrot above a donkey. But time is changing. The new generations seems to be more mature to quickly  understand that life can be short, that nothing is really secure, and they work more in a place that correspond to their first motivation. Money is important but comes after the reason of the day job. And I think that it's a good idea. Even, a way to make good results. When you are running all days only for making money, you never make great innovations like when you have the fire to make goals. When all your mind goes straight to the point, for the result, for your motivation, to make an enjoyable job because you give it a sense to it, often the success isn't really far, and the money neither.</answer>
