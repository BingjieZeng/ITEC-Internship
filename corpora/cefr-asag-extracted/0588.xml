        <answer>According to my opinion, an enjoyable job is more important than a job that brings more money even if we need money to cope with life. I think that when we are working on an enjoyable job, we are more satisfied with our life when coming back in the evening, we don't worry about lots of points that make induce questioning about the aim of our existence. A job that brings money may surely seem like being more reassuring . But, when someorne executes a job that he has chosen in full awareness and with interest, he seems to be less fed up with his daily obligations. He will execute his duties with a light heart and a good energy. Only this is really satisfying and grateful when he comes home and there is no reason to worry about the usefulness of his existence. Executing ones work wtih  a light heart and pleasure seems far more easy and satisfying, there is no reason to worry about lots of useless questions. This person, that enjoys his job and copes wih everything his job requires, has  a real merit doing everything his job requires. When this person needs more money, he is even able to find a complementary source of incomes because he or she isn't fed up by his or her current job. That may  leave him or her enough energy to cope with a second job after work if there is a need or it.</answer>
