        <answer>Study abroad would be an interesting way for students to learn or improve easier a new language. So for students who are learning new language it should be a compulsory part of education because you can't learn a new language without immersion. An this for all field of sudy because it's also a way to increase each student selfconfidence and open new horizons to the student letting Him/She take some responsabilities by him/herself and see how our contry or way of life is different from where they'll be studying.</answer>
        <answer>So yes, at least instead of being a compulsory part of education, it should be an opportunity each student could choose to take or not. Being compulsory could lead to help students who cant afford it with some financial help too.</answer>
