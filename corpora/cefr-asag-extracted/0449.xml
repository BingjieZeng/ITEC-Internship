        <answer>It was in my city and I was 13 years old. With a friend, we decided to discover our own city. We walked in very old small streets, we admired splendide houses from past times, we visited museums...  There is a very beautiful church in my town, much visited by tourists. That day we had a guide just for us, so we could play some notes on the organ, we even went under the roof and it was great!</answer>
