        <answer>The best book I've ever read is the Harry Potter saga, which is composed by 7 books. I love reading this book because the writer talks of a new, magic world which a lot of character and also a lot of moral basis, like friendship, relationship, happiness and the fight between the good and the evil's character.</answer>
        <answer>I started reading these books when I was very young, around 11 years old, when the first book had been published. One years later J. K. Rowling, the writer, decided to transform her immaginatory's books into film's saga. And I started to go further with the books and the film together because I love finding another place from reality and improving my immagination, but also because everyone at that time was reading that.</answer>
        <answer>Ten year later I started to read all the books and I found totally a new book because I was around 19 years old, I totally understand the moral basis that I talked before and I really love them and I think that everyone should read the books.</answer>
