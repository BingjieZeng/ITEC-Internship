        <answer>I think the better advice I have to give is &quot;Be healthy&quot;. Why, because if you stop drinking or eating chimical food, you'll make our environment safer. For example, if you stop to drink soda, the companys will product less plastic which, part of it, finally stays in the oceans and kills fishes and the others. That safes not only our nature but people who can't drink a healthy water because of it too, like some countries in Asia (India,...).Some people in Brazil have to replace theirs habits (to drink water) by buying Coca-Cola because it's less expensif.</answer>
        <answer>You can not only change your life but theirs too with doing only this easy thing.</answer>
