        <answer>In order to help our environment, and as long that you are not somewhat like a prime minister of the USA or China, my biggest advice would be to always ask yourself if the action you are going to take is really helpful for our planet. I explain my idea : at every moment while at home, at work or every where else, if you are going to do something, try to quickly mentally guess if your action is environmentally the best one to do like : &quot;Is it better for our nature that I keep the tap of the sink open while I am using the soap or that I close the water?&quot;</answer>
