        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I would save the half of it and I would use the other half to buy presents for my family in Belgium and in Vietman but also for my friends. I hope I would make them happy. For exemple, I would buy tickets for my parents so that they could visit my family in Vietnam. I would also use it to buy me some things I like. Maybe I would give a donation to an association that helps poor people.</answer>
