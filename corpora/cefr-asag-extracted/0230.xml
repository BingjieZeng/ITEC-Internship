        <answer>If I had 1 million euros to spend, I will probably give a huge part to the people who needs it. I'll keep a small part to spend it with my family and friends and the rest will certainly go on a bank, which will permit me in few years to give a big part of this money to associations again. I'll use it also to travelled the world and discover different cultures, the way of life of the people from different countries and offer myself a great life lesson.</answer>
