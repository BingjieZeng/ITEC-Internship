        <answer>The most important thing to know is that if I had one million euros, I would give the half to help people who need it. I wouldn't give everything to associations as soon as I receive it, but I would keep it until something happens in the world, like a earthquake, so I can help people at the moment they need it the most.</answer>
        <answer>Then, with the rest of my fortune, I want to have a good life with my family. I think I would keep working because I need to see a lot of different people every day and I couldn't stay at home all day long...</answer>
        <answer>For the rest, all I need is to see my family happy and to live without any stress. I don't want to have a big house and an expensive car to show to everybody that I'm rich, but I know that when we have a lot of money it's like a vicious circle : we can't go out of it and we always want more and more money...</answer>
        <answer>I hope I'll be able to keep a &quot;normal&quot; life, I just want to be happy and everyone know that money don't always make us happy !</answer>
