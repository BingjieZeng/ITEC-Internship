        <answer>If I had 1 milion euros, I think I would probably give half of the money to an association. Something that will help the world to get better. An association that works for the environnement or that works to eradiquate the hunger in the world. With the rest of my money, I will buy a nice house in a nice place (warm land) and keep working at my job. If I don't like my job (if it doesn't suit me well), I will change. After all, I have all the money I want : I can be &quot;jobless&quot; during a while  If I have some money left, I will spend it for my parents or for my children, so they can have a good education and a good future.</answer>
