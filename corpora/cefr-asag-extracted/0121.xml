        <answer>The best book I've ever read is probably &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; by Stephen King. In this book, there's a strange mix of passion, self-awareness, secrets, lies, action and fear (what's bring us more than fascination). It's a book who's adressed to a large public (but maybe not for kids ...). That's the untying of the sage Harry Potter and I have to say that I'm not disappointed ! When I've opened this book, I wasn't able to close it anyway. I advise to read this masterpiece as soon as possible !</answer>
