        <answer>The Fashion Week in Paris is an extremely big event for the city. In fact, it brings together a lot of poeple from the four sides of the planet.</answer>
        <answer>I went to two shows, the first was Valentino and the second was Chanel. It's very impressive to go to that kind of event because you meet important poeple from the world of fashion and your behaviour has to be perfect.</answer>
        <answer>Everyone i for sure extremely well dressed. It's all about fashion and beauty, all about appearance actually. When you think about that, it's pretty awfull. Poeple go to that kind of show to be seen, to be admired and at the end, this has nothing more to have with fashion.</answer>
        <answer>Anyway it was a good experience but you have to keep in your mind that it's all very superficial and fake.</answer>
