        <answer>With one million euros, I would travel the world! Sometimes on my own, sometimes with the people I love. Also, I would help my mum to fix all the little things who goes wrong in the house. And I would make presents to my friends and family. I really like making people happy with gift, even little things, little attentions, when they are not waiting for it. But doing that can costs a lot... I don't think I would buy things very expensive, except the flights tickets, above all I would make people around me happy.</answer>
