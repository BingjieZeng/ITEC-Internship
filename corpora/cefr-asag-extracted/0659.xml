        <answer>The environment, our contemporary green gold, is key for human life, and after many years of drawing resources, the mankind has realised it is really necessary to stop this massacre until it becomes irremediable. In order to live on a sustainable manner without coming back to the Prehsitoric times, I would carry on building off-shore and inland wind turbines, multiplying solar panels on roofs and on parkings to load electric car. I would also encourage inhabitants from developed countries first, as they are more disposed financially to make efforts, to compost and plat trees in their garden and to sort out their wastes more consciously. As farmming has a big impact on our planet, it is an emergency to get people conscious about the need they decrease thei meat consumption. Though we already have observed changes, I would encourage financially companies, universities, schools that promote the right attitude and invest in and implement efficient autonomous facilities and the use of ecological products. Finally the mankind have the capacity to live sustainably but do ou politicians and lobbies be ready to move in a radically manner from a polluting to a greener free-market economy</answer>
