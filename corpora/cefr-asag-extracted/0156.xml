        <answer>The best book I've ever read is 20 miles under the seas by Jules Vernes. When I was 8, I had many books wrotten by this autor. The story occured under the sea. A terrible monster (looking like a giant octopus) was attacking many boats. In order to react at this threat, men organised a big expedition to kill the monster. According to them, it was nothing more than a big shark or a giant octopus. But what they discovered was scarier than their expectations. In fact, in the deep sea, they met an opponent. Neither the swords, neither the spears could beat it. For the first time in human history, men have to fight against a opponent stronger than them.</answer>
