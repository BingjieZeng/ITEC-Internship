        <answer>In my opinion, social networks such as Facebook or Twitter or Instagram have a big impact on relationships. Because you always have to be careful of what you post in the public sphere. Pictures or even words can produce real troubles and can cause public disruptcies on the social life of the person who has posted them on the internet. Those social networks can also make trouble within families, because of a uncareful word in a commentary or in a conservation, families can be separated. Social networks have change the meaning of relationships and there is no turn around on that turf. If you're active on a social network, you'll always have to be careful of what you say because it is hard to repair something on the internet, it is not the same if you have the person in front of you and you can tell or what you mean.</answer>
        <answer>To conclude, social networks have a big impact on relationships and it can't be underestimated.</answer>
