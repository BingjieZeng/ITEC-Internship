        <answer>I have just seen Batman vs Superman and I couldn't miss the occasion to share with you my opinion. I won't speak about all the aspects of the movie (I mean the plot, the actors or the music) because I would be too long to explain and you can easily find that on the internet. I just want to share something like verdict with you. Here is mine : it was good ! Whatever you could hear on the social networks or in the newspapers just remember this famous quote &quot;don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;. I couldn't be more true. The fact that I like this blockbuster and superheroes movies may sounds strange for most of you but I find in this kind of stories something similar with greek mythology.. You will also notice some obvious references to Greece and also some potential philosophy subjects. You should definitely go there and see the movie, I hope you will enjoy it as much as me. Don't forget to comment.</answer>
