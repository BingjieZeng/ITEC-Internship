        <answer>Two years ago, I went to a casting in Li√®ge for a film written by the brothers Dardenne. It was interresting. I had to tell a text behind a camera. The two brothers were there and gave me some informations to made it better. After the casting, they didn't give me any return. So I dreamed of meeting some stars like Marion Cotillard. I waited for a reponse during a long month. At the end, I not hopped so much. If I could, I'll do it again. It's a good experience.</answer>
