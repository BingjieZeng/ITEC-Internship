        <answer>I think that eating a balanced is a central piece to maintain or reach a healthy lifestyle. It means that you can eat of everything, but in an appropriate amount compared to dietetic rules and food pyramid. If you exclude a category of nutriments or if you follow a monodiet regimen, it will have a worse impact on your body than doing nothing. Every category of nutriment is important: protein to construct the muscles, lipids to repair the cells, carbohydrats to give strenght and energy, but most of all water for life! Nevertheless, I've heard that without physical exercice, healthy diet is less effective. Combined with it, it can for instance revert type 2 diabetes symptoms, diminish the risk of cardiovascular diseases, reduce arthritis disorders. Healthy lifestyle is something global, it includes the diet, but also the physical exercice, the quality of sleep, avoiding alcohol and tobacco use, emotional management, adaptation skills and social support.</answer>
