        <answer>We need money to feed ourselves, to pay basics things like shoes, clothes, education...</answer>
        <answer>But do we need a lot of money?</answer>
        <answer>Personally, if I have enough to fulfill these basics needs and a few more such as having hobbies, I'm happy.</answer>
        <answer>Actually this is the real question : what do we need to be happy in life?</answer>
        <answer>The answer for me is more having friends, being self confident, being healthy... A way to achieve this goal, be happy in life, is to have an enjoyable job.</answer>
        <answer>We spend a huge amount of time at work so having a job that we like (maybe love?) is more than a first step to live better. It is necessary.</answer>
