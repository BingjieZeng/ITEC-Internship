        <answer>Well, I did not read lot of books so it is not really relevent. I think the best book I ever read is &quot;the alchemist&quot; from Paulo Coelho. I do not remember very well the story but the idea is that one man (the hero) has a big journey to find a treasure : he met some people (good and bad one), he travel thru mountains and desert to find that the treasure is where his quest start. I like this book because it helped me to know what is very important on my life. After I read this book, I change the way I am thinking about life.</answer>
