The real question is : who is scaling the initial scale in order to keep as long as possible the power of the scale ownership factor  ? ..

History shows that any species alive deserves what is best for them but jealousness as failed in giving what any species really deserves. Free choices as well as imposed ones are not anymore at stake. What will define the future steps of the evolution process is our ability to learn from history, to live it through experiences, to learn to look ahead and to share. {name}. {name}. {name}. {name}.</answer>
