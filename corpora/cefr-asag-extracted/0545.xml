        <answer>1 million euros ! Whaou ! I would love to have this chance ! I will invest in real estate ! I'm studying real estate at school so I think it's curently a good investment for the future. My money will be safe !</answer>
        <answer>Furthermore I will give a part of the money to association for the serenity of animals or humans. I always wanted help the weakest. I hate poverty. I'm not rich and I won't be rich, I just want to help other people with the money I won. 1 million euros is an amount too high for only one person. It must make happy more people ! Of course I'm always dreaming of a perfect life ! With a new build, a big garden and beautiful children but the money doesn't make joy ;-)</answer>
