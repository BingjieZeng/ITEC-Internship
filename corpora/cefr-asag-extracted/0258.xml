        <answer>If I had 1 million euros, I think that I would travel all around the world. I would take a flight from Belgium to the United States. There I would begin my trip in New York. I would walk in the different districts, observe the big buildings and take some nice pictures. I would maybe do some shopping too. Then I would travel by car (I would rent one) to Las Vegas to spend my money in the casinos. After this city, I would discover the nature. Then I would go to Canada. I would enjoy to try the erabl siroop and to swim in a warm swimming pool to get warmer. After Canada, I would go to Australia.</answer>
        <answer>With the rest of my money I would buy a lovely house in Switzerland. It would be modern, spaciuous and there would be a big garden. I could see the Leman lake from my room.</answer>
