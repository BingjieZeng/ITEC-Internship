    <answers>
        <answer>I would invest in a house of moreover 300.000 €. I would also buy a car for 30.000 € maximum. I would put all the rest at the bank on a spare account.</answer>
        <answer>For me, 1 million is far not enough to stop working, so it's a very good help to avoid a leaning at the bank, a lot of people earns a million in their entire life. I would also maybe go on holliday every year, or make a party to celebrate my million € but no excess like a Porsche of 300.000 € or expensive party's. To finish, I would say that 1 million make life more easy but don't change it in a radical way.</answer>
