        <answer>Yesterday, I've been to the Revue of the CESEC circle. Do you know what is it? In fact, you find a lot of arts. There are dances, songs, theater made by the students and for the students. The actors play the role of the professor from the University of Louvain-la-Neuve. So the professor come to the Revue and are specator just as the student who wants to see their friends which organise and plays in the Revue. This year it happened in the Salmigondis place because the Aula Magna was too expensive. So it was a real challenge for them : there is no scene, no lights, no curtains. In three days, the organisator have to do the best to make it real! And they did it, there was a lot of humour. After, the professor offered beers to everybody to thank them for the show !</answer>
