        <answer>My favourite book is called &quot;The five languages of love&quot;.</answer>
        <answer>It's written by a pastor who works as a kind of psychologist (he listens to people who have difficulties or who are in emotional distress). By listening to many different people he learned a lot about &quot;love&quot; and the different kinds of how people express their love to others. That's how he discovered the five languages of love: &quot;the physical touching/tenderness&quot;, &quot;moments of quality&quot;, &quot;serviability&quot;, &quot;presents&quot; and &quot;praising by words&quot;. In the book he describes theese different languages by giving some theoretical aspects and also some personal statements of people that he met during the years.</answer>
