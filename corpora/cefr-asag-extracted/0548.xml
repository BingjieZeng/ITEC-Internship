        <answer>The house of happiness</answer>
        <answer>I'm only fifty-two years old but I sometimes think about the old age. When I see old people who can't stay any more alone at home, I'm sad. I know some of them in my circle. Their children are obliged to put them in an old people's home. They would prefer to stay with their family and friends.</answer>
        <answer>If I won one million euros, here's what I would do: I would buy a piece of land and I would build a comfortable house with some flats. Every flat would contain a bedroom, a bathroom and a sitting room.</answer>
        <answer>In this building, there would be also rooms for the community life as a kitchen, a living-room, a sitting-room with a television, a terrace and a garden. Many people like a cook, a nurse, a gardener and others would be in charge of the elderly people and would live among them with their family.</answer>
        <answer>So these people would never be alone and would live happy.</answer>
        <answer>One day, when I'll be old, I would seize the opportunity to live like them in my house of happiness.</answer>
