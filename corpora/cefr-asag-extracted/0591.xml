        <answer>The advice i would like to give is about different means to move in our life. The use of public transports or cycling can considerably reduce pollutants in the air and this can be benefit for our health and enviroment. Of course, the choice to go to school or to go to work by foot or by cycle depends on several parameters : distance and duration between home and workplace, children you have to drop to school, meteorological conditions or even things to carry. The use of car seems anyway the easiest means of transport. But we notice day after day that this way is not sustainable. For future generations, it's now time to have all of us a reflection on how to move!</answer>
