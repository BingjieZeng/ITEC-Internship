        <answer>In 10 years, I would like to live and work in Canada because I love this country. I hope I would work in a big company in the Human Resources. I also hope that I will have a husband and 2 children. I think that my family will miss me and I will miss them but I don't want to stay in Belgium. It's my country but there is no future for my generation and the governement don't do the best for the poeple. They only think for the money.</answer>
