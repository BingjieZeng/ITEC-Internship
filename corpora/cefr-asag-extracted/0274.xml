        <answer>In my view, both having an enjoyable job and making money are important.</answer>
        <answer>On the one hand, you need to have a job you like because otherwise you won't work with pleasure and feel happy to go to your workplace or even try to do your best to make a good job.</answer>
        <answer>But, on the other hand, if you are not well paid or paid enough for the work you do, you will feel disapointed and you won't be happy neither.</answer>
        <answer>Those are the reasons why I really tend to think that both having a job you like and being well paid are both important !</answer>
