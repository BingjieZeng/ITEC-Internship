        <answer>While both factors are important, I believe having an enjoyable job is more crucial. Money can provide a comfortable lifestyle, but if one is not happy with their job, it can lead to stress, burnout, and overall dissatisfaction. On the other hand, an enjoyable job can bring fulfillment, motivation, and a sense of purpose, which can lead to better performance and longevity in the workplace. Moreover, happiness at work can positively impact one's mental and physical health, relationships, and overall quality of life. Therefore, finding a job that aligns with one's interests, values, and skills is essential for a balanced and happy life.</answer>
