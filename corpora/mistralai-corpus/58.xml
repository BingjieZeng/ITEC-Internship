    <answers>
        <answer>Study abroad should not be compulsory but strongly encouraged as part of education due to several reasons. Firstly, it broadens one's perspective by exposing them to diverse cultures, traditions, and ways of life. This cultural immersion fosters understanding, empathy, and tolerance, which are crucial in today's globalized world. Secondly, studying abroad offers opportunities for language acquisition and improvement, as students are immersed in a foreign language environment. Lastly, it enhances personal growth and independence, as students learn to navigate unfamiliar surroundings, adapt to new situations, and manage their own affairs. While the financial aspect may pose a challenge, scholarships, work-study programs, and part-time jobs can help alleviate this burden. In conclusion, while study abroad may not be practical for everyone, it is an enriching experience that should be accessible to as many students as possible.</answer>
