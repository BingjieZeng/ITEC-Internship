        <answer>Study abroad should not be a compulsory part of education. While studying abroad offers a wealth of benefits, such as language immersion, cultural exposure, and personal growth, it is not feasible for everyone due to financial constraints, family responsibilities, or personal reasons. Mandating study abroad could unfairly exclude these individuals from educational opportunities. Instead, it should remain an optional experience, allowing students to pursue it if they choose and are able to do so. Additionally, there are other ways to achieve similar benefits, such as hosting international students or participating in virtual exchanges. Ultimately, the decision to study abroad should be left to the individual student and their family.</answer>
