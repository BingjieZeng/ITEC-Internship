A balanced diet includes a variety of food groups such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and dairy products. Each of these food groups offers unique nutritional benefits that contribute to our overall health.</answer>
        <answer>For instance, fruits and vegetables are rich in essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, which help prevent chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.

Dairy products are a significant source of calcium and vitamin D, crucial for maintaining strong bones and teeth.</answer>
