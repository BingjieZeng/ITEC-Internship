        <answer>Last summer, I went on a family holiday to Spain. My parents, brother and I spent a week in a beautiful coastal town called Benidorm. The highlight of the trip was our visit to the Aqua Natura water park. We spent the whole day there, sliding down various water slides, relaxing in the lazy river and enjoying the wave pool. It was an unforgettable experience!</answer>
