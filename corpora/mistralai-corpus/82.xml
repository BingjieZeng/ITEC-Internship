        <answer>Firstly, a balanced diet ensures that our body receives an adequate amount of macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which are essential for energy production, muscle growth, and maintaining cell membranes. Additionally, it provides micronutrients like vitamins and minerals, which are crucial for various bodily functions, such as immunity, bone health, and vision.</answer>
