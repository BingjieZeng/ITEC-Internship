        <answer>Last summer, my family and I went on a holiday to Greece. We spent a week on the beautiful island of Santorini. It was my first time there, and I was amazed by the stunning blue waters, white buildings, and colorful sunsets. One day, we rented a boat and sailed around the island. We swam in the crystal-clear waters of the Red Beach and visited the ancient city of Akrotiri. It was an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait to go back again!</answer>
