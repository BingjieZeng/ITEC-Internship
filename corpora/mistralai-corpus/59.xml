    <answers>
        <answer>Study abroad should not be compulsory but strongly encouraged as part of education. This is because it broadens one's horizons, fosters cultural understanding, and enhances language skills. Living and studying in a foreign country exposes students to diverse cultures, customs, and perspectives, which enriches their worldview. It also improves language skills, as students are immersed in the language and must communicate effectively in their daily lives. However, making it compulsory could be problematic, as it may be financially burdensome for some students and families. Instead, providing scholarships and grants to support study abroad experiences could help make it more accessible. Ultimately, the decision to study abroad should be a personal one, guided by individual interests, goals, and circumstances.</answer>
