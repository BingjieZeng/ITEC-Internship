        <answer>Last summer, my family and I went to Greece for a two-week vacation. We visited the famous islands like Santorini, Mykonos, and Crete. On Mykonos, we rented a boat and went to a secluded beach. There, we had a barbecue, swam in the crystal-clear water, and enjoyed the stunning sunset. It was an unforgettable experience that brought us closer together as a family.</answer>
