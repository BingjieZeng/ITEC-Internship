        <answer>People who live in the public eye, such as celebrities, politicians, and athletes, are often subject to intense scrutiny and public attention.

Everyone, regardless of their profession or status, has the right to lead a private life and to be free from unwarranted intrusion into their personal affairs. Celebrities and other public figures are no exception to this rule.</answer>
        <answer>However, the reality is that people in the public eye often have less privacy than the average person. This is because the media and the public have an insatiable appetite for information about their lives, and they are often willing to invade their privacy in order to satisfy this demand.
