        <answer>One of my favourite holidays was in Barcelona with my family. We rented a lovely apartment in the Gothic Quarter and spent our days exploring the city's rich history, sampling delicious tapas, and relaxing on the beach. One unforgettable moment was when we watched a mesmerising flamenco performance at a local restaurant, surrounded by the vibrant atmosphere of the city. It was a truly magical experience that I will always cherish.</answer>
